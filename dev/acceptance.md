# Acceptance Criteria

Format:

```markdown
## AC-NNN: <short title>

**Requirement ref:** REQ-NNN
**Test id:** T-NNN (placeholder; bound by test-plan.md)
**Assertion:** <single observable, measurable, falsifiable statement>
**Measurement:** <how it's checked>
**Fixture:** <name of fixture, or "test-plan.md fixture spec — pending">
```

Rules:

- Unique `AC-NNN` id; numbering stable; suffixes a/b/c when an outcome
  splits.
- One assertion per AC (no compounds — no AND chains, no comma-list of
  observables).
- No "should / ideally / reasonable" — binary outcomes only.
- Every REQ in `requirements.md` has ≥1 AC.
- Every AC has a placeholder T-NNN; `test-plan.md` (Phase 3f) binds
  T-NNN to real test scaffolds.
- Every AC names its fixture, or explicitly marks the fixture as
  pending `test-plan.md`. ACs whose fixture is pending are
  **lock-blocking** on `test-plan.md`.
- Numerical gates restate the cited accepted ADR. AC must not
  introduce numbers absent from the ADR — if a measurement parameter
  (warmup, sample count, tolerance) is needed beyond the ADR, the
  parameter is owned by `test-plan.md`, not invented inline.

T-NNN ids are placeholders until `test-plan.md` issues real ones.

## Parameter table

acceptance.md OWNS every numerical measurement parameter cited by an
AC. test-plan.md is the _measurer_ — it executes the protocol but does
not own the threshold. Parameters with an ADR source restate the ADR.
Parameters without an ADR source are owned by this doc and bound at
acceptance lock; changing them post-lock follows the same critic + HITL
cycle as any other acceptance amendment.

Discoverability: this is the canonical home for human + machine lookup
of a parameter value. CI/test scripts consume parameters by `P-ID` from
this table.

Parameters used inline by their assertion (e.g. AC-007a's `100 ms`
slow-statement default threshold; AC-022c's `5 s` close-to-exit) are
already in the AC text and not duplicated here — they restate
`requirements.md` REQ-006a / REQ-020b which are themselves anchored.

## Traceability matrix

REQ → AC → P-ID coverage. Every numeric AC parameter resolves through
this table to either an ADR or to an acceptance.md self-owned bullet.

## Observability

## AC-001: Lifecycle phase tag is a typed enum

**Requirement ref:** REQ-001
**Test id:** T-001
**Assertion:** Every lifecycle event carries a `phase` field whose value is one of the typed constants `{Started, Slow, Heartbeat, Finished, Failed}`, programmatically retrievable as the typed value (not as a substring of a free-text field). (Slow-transition emission coverage: AC-008.)
**Measurement:** Subscribe to lifecycle events for an open + 10-write + 10-search + close sequence; assert each event's `phase` field deserializes to one of the five constants; assert zero events require string parsing to extract the phase.
**Fixture:** standard-mixed-workload (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-002: No log files written without subscriber

**Requirement ref:** REQ-002
**Test id:** T-002
**Assertion:** With no host subscriber registered, an open + write + search + close cycle creates no new files outside the documented allow-list (DB file, `.lock`, WAL, `-shm` (WAL shared-memory wal-index, per ADR-0.6.0-database-lock-mechanism-reader-pool-revision), optional rollback `.journal`).
**Measurement:** Snapshot recursive directory tree of `$PWD`, `$HOME`, `$XDG_*`, `$TMPDIR` pre+post; assert diff = subset of allow-list paths.
**Fixture:** clean-temp-root (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-003a: Writer events flow to host subscriber

**Requirement ref:** REQ-002
**Test id:** T-003a
**Assertion:** A write operation produces ≥ 1 event delivered to the host's idiomatic logging hook before the write call returns to the caller.
**Measurement:** Register binding-idiomatic logging hook; capture events; perform 1 write; assert ≥ 1 captured event with `category=writer` whose capture-ordinal precedes the write's return.
**Fixture:** single-write fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-003b: Search events flow to host subscriber

**Requirement ref:** REQ-002
**Test id:** T-003b
**Assertion:** A search operation produces ≥ 1 `category=search` event delivered to the host hook before the call returns.
**Measurement:** As AC-003a with search.
**Fixture:** single-search fixture.

## AC-003c: Admin events flow to host subscriber

**Requirement ref:** REQ-002
**Test id:** T-003c
**Assertion:** An admin operation produces ≥ 1 `category=admin` event delivered to the host hook before the call returns.
**Measurement:** As AC-003a with admin.configure.
**Fixture:** single-admin fixture.

## AC-003d: Error events flow to host subscriber

**Requirement ref:** REQ-002
**Test id:** T-003d
**Assertion:** A failing operation produces ≥ 1 `category=error` event delivered to the host hook before the failure is raised to the caller.
**Measurement:** Trigger a deterministic failure (poison fixture); assert ≥ 1 `category=error` event with capture-ordinal < raise-ordinal.
**Fixture:** poison-fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-004a: Counter snapshot exposes documented key set

**Requirement ref:** REQ-003
**Test id:** T-004a
**Assertion:** A counter snapshot contains the keys: `queries`, `writes`, `write_rows`, `errors_by_code`, `admin_ops`, `cache_hit`, `cache_miss`.
**Measurement:** Read snapshot on a fresh engine; assert exact key-set equality.
**Fixture:** fresh-engine.

## AC-004b: Counter delta exact for write/query keys

**Requirement ref:** REQ-003
**Test id:** T-004b
**Assertion:** Snapshot delta over N=1,000 mixed ops equals issued op counts exactly for `queries`, `writes`, `write_rows`, `admin_ops`. `cache_hit` / `cache_miss` are monotonic non-decreasing.
**Measurement:** Snapshot at t0; run fixture; snapshot at t1; assert per-key arithmetic.
**Fixture:** mixed-1000-ops fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-004c: Counter snapshot read does not perturb counters

**Requirement ref:** REQ-003
**Test id:** T-004c
**Assertion:** Reading a counter snapshot increments no counter on the snapshot itself.
**Measurement:** Snapshot S0; snapshot S1 immediately after; assert S0 == S1 for every key.
**Fixture:** quiescent-engine.

## AC-005a: Per-statement profiling toggleable at runtime

**Requirement ref:** REQ-004
**Test id:** T-005a
**Assertion:** A documented API call enables per-statement profiling on a running engine without restart and without rebuild.
**Measurement:** Open engine; assert profiling disabled (no profile records on a fixture query); call enable-profiling API; assert subsequent fixture query emits ≥ 1 profile record.
**Fixture:** non-trivial-select fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending — must scan ≥ 1 row).

## AC-005b: Profile record schema

**Requirement ref:** REQ-004
**Test id:** T-005b
**Assertion:** A profile record exposes fields `wall_clock_ms`, `step_count`, `cache_delta` as typed numeric values.
**Measurement:** Emit one profile record via AC-005a; deserialize; assert all three fields present and numeric.
**Fixture:** as AC-005a.

## AC-006: SQLite-internal events surfaced with typed source tag

**Requirement ref:** REQ-005
**Test id:** T-006
**Assertion:** SQLite-internal corruption / recovery / I/O events carry a `source` field equal to the typed constant `SqliteInternal` and a `category` field equal to a value from the documented SQLite-internal category set.
**Measurement:** Inject corruption via the documented corruption-injection harness; reopen; assert ≥ 1 captured event with `source == SqliteInternal` and `category` ∈ documented set.
**Fixture:** corrupt-page harness (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending; must include a documented page-corruption tool).

## AC-007a: Slow-statement event at default threshold

**Requirement ref:** REQ-006a
**Test id:** T-007a
**Assertion:** A statement whose wall-clock duration exceeds 100 ms emits exactly one slow-statement event identifying the statement.
**Measurement:** Run the deterministic-slow fixture (≥ 200 ms guaranteed by recursive-CTE counter); assert exactly one slow-statement event with the matching statement id.
**Fixture:** deterministic-slow-cte fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-007b: Slow threshold reconfigurable at runtime

**Requirement ref:** REQ-006a
**Test id:** T-007b
**Assertion:** Setting threshold to N ms via documented API causes statements with measured duration ≥ N ms to emit a slow event and statements with measured duration < N ms not to emit.
**Measurement:** Set N=500; run fast-fixture (≤ 200 ms guaranteed) → assert no slow event; run slow-fixture (≥ 600 ms guaranteed) → assert one slow event.
**Fixture:** fast-fixture + slow-fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-008: Slow signal participates in lifecycle attribution

**Requirement ref:** REQ-006b
**Test id:** T-008
**Assertion:** A statement crossing the slow threshold causes the lifecycle phase tag to take the value `Slow` for ≥ 1 event during the statement's wall-clock window.
**Measurement:** Subscribe to lifecycle stream; run 1 fast + 1 slow + 1 fast statement; assert the slow statement's wall-clock window contains ≥ 1 event with `phase == Slow` (subsequence, not contiguous order).
**Fixture:** as AC-007a.

## AC-009: Stress-failure event field schema

**Requirement ref:** REQ-007
**Test id:** T-009
**Assertion:** A stress-test failure event deserializes into a typed payload with fields `thread_group_id`, `op_kind`, `last_error_chain`, `projection_state`, each non-empty for the failing scenario.
**Measurement:** Run robustness suite with one-thread poison fixture; deserialize the failure event payload using the documented serde-typed schema; assert all four fields populated.
**Fixture:** one-thread-poison robustness fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-010: Projection-status enum coverage

**Requirement ref:** REQ-008
**Test id:** T-010
**Assertion:** Projection-status query returns a value from the typed enum `{Pending, Failed, UpToDate}` for every kind with vector indexing enabled.
**Measurement:** Three named fixtures (pending — frozen scheduler; failed — poison embedder; up-to-date — quiescent); assert returned enum value matches expected.
**Fixture:** projection-status-three-state fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## Performance

(Numerical gates restate ADR thresholds; measurement parameters
— warmup, sample count, runner pinning, tolerances — are owned by the
**Parameter table** above (cited by P-ID). `test-plan.md` is the
_measurer_ that executes the protocol; it does not own thresholds.
Fixture data corpora at scale (1M-row, 1GB-DB, harness binaries) are
the only test-plan.md responsibility for this section.)

## AC-011a: Write throughput @ 1 KB ≥ 1,000 commits/sec

**Requirement ref:** REQ-009a
**Test id:** T-011a
**Assertion:** Sequential `WriteTx` commits with 1 KB payload sustain ≥ 1,000 commits/sec.
**Measurement:** P-WTP-WARMUP warmup → P-WTP-RUN steady-state measurement window; commits/sec computed over the run window; CI gate fails if value < 1,000.
**Fixture:** write-throughput-1kb (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-011b: Write throughput @ 100 KB ≥ 100 commits/sec

**Requirement ref:** REQ-009b
**Test id:** T-011b
**Assertion:** Sequential `WriteTx` commits with 100 KB payload sustain ≥ 100 commits/sec, measured per the same protocol.
**Measurement:** As AC-011a with 100 KB payload.
**Fixture:** write-throughput-100kb (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-012: Text query latency on FTS5 path

**Status:** budget **superseded by AC-076** (revised, tiered: 10k binding, 100k/1M tracked) per `ADR-0.7.0-text-query-latency-gates-revised`, HITL-ruled 2026-06-07 (0.8.0 Slice 40). The unconditional p50 ≤ 20 / p99 ≤ 150 ms at 100k below is the legacy 0.6.0 budget, retained for history. The latency is O(N) FTS-scan cost, not the tokenizer (Slice 6).

**Requirement ref:** REQ-010
**Test id:** T-012
**Assertion:** Text-only query latency on the documented FTS5 fixture meets p50 ≤ 20 ms AND p99 ≤ 150 ms over ≥ P-PERF-SAMPLES samples on a single distribution.
**Measurement:** Per ADR-0.6.0-text-query-latency-gates workload (warmup discard + second-pass measurement, QPS=1, 50–90th percentile token-frequency band); CI gate fails if either percentile exceeds.
**Fixture:** text-query-1m-chunk (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-013: Vector retrieval latency

**Requirement ref:** REQ-011
**Test id:** T-013
**Assertion:** Vector retrieval on the documented vector fixture meets p50 ≤ 50 ms AND p99 ≤ 200 ms over ≥ P-PERF-SAMPLES samples.
**Measurement:** Per ADR-0.6.0-retrieval-latency-gates workload (warmup discard + second-pass, QPS=1); CI gate fails if either percentile exceeds.
**Fixture:** vector-1m-768d (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).
**Status:** budget **superseded by AC-072** (revised, tiered) per `ADR-0.7.0-text-query-latency-gates-revised` (HITL-locked 2026-06-01). The p50 ≤ 50 / p99 ≤ 200 ms above is the legacy 0.6.0 budget, retained for history.

## AC-014: `doctor safe-export` ≤ 500 ms on seeded dataset

**Requirement ref:** REQ-012
**Test id:** T-014
**Assertion:** `fathomdb doctor safe-export <out> --json` completes within 500 ms wall-clock on the seeded benchmark dataset.
**Measurement:** Single CLI execution against the seeded fixture; CI gate fails if wall-clock > 500 ms. (Single-sample assertion sufficient — gate is a hard ceiling, not a percentile.)
**Fixture:** seeded-benchmark-dataset (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-015: Canonical-read freshness within write tx

**Requirement ref:** REQ-013
**Test id:** T-015
**Assertion:** A canonical-row read issued immediately after `write` returns reflects the just-written row on the first call (no retry, no poll).
**Measurement:** Single-thread test: write row R, immediately query R by id without intervening operation; assert R returned on first call; per-call wall-clock ≤ 50 ms; repeat 1,000 times; assert 100% first-call success.
**Fixture:** canonical-write-read fixture.

## AC-016: FTS-search freshness within write tx

**Requirement ref:** REQ-014
**Test id:** T-016
**Assertion:** An FTS5 query for a token unique to a just-written row returns that row on the first call after `write` returns.
**Measurement:** Same protocol as AC-015 with FTS5 query for a unique token; per-call wall-clock ≤ 50 ms; 1,000 iterations; 100% first-call success.
**Fixture:** unique-token fixture.

## AC-017: Vector-projection freshness p99 ≤ 5 s

**Requirement ref:** REQ-015
**Test id:** T-017
**Assertion:** Latency from write commit to projection-cursor reaching the commit's cursor value has p99 ≤ 5,000 ms over ≥ P-PERF-SAMPLES samples.
**Measurement:** Per write: capture commit-cursor `c_w` (REQ-055 surface); poll read-tx cursor until `c_r >= c_w`; record polling-completion time minus commit time; report p99; CI gate fails if > 5,000 ms.
**Fixture:** projection-freshness fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending sample-count).

## AC-018: Drain of 100 vectors ≤ 2 s

**Requirement ref:** REQ-016
**Test id:** T-018
**Assertion:** The bounded-completion `Engine` instance method `drain` (per REQ-030) called with 100 pending deterministic-embedder vectors returns within 2 s wall-clock.
**Measurement:** Enqueue 100 writes against deterministic embedder; immediately call `engine.drain` with 5 s timeout; assert returns within 2 s with all 100 vectors materialized.
**Fixture:** deterministic-embedder-100-vector fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-019: Mixed-retrieval stress workload tail

**Requirement ref:** REQ-017
**Test id:** T-019
**Assertion:** Under the documented mixed-retrieval stress workload, read p99 ≤ `max(P-STRESS-MULT × baseline_p99, P-STRESS-FLOOR)` over ≥ P-PERF-SAMPLES samples, where `baseline_p99` is captured by re-running AC-013's protocol immediately preceding this AC in the same CI job.
**Measurement:** Run baseline first; freeze workload; run stress; assert bound.
**Fixture:** mixed-retrieval-stress (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).
**Status:** budget **superseded by AC-073** (revised, tiered; real-corpus is the verdict, synthetic `perf_gates` AC-019 is report-only) per `ADR-0.7.0-text-query-latency-gates-revised` (HITL-locked 2026-06-01).

## AC-020: Reads do not serialize on a single reader connection

**Requirement ref:** REQ-018
**Test id:** T-020
**Assertion:** N=8 concurrent reader threads each running the documented read-mix complete in wall-clock ≤ P-PARALLEL-TOL × `(T_seq / N)`, where `T_seq` is the sequential N-iteration wall-clock.
**Measurement:** Run sequential and concurrent variants; assert the bound; fail CI if exceeded.
**Fixture:** interactive-read-mix (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending — must specify per-query-type ratios + tolerance).

## Reliability

## AC-021: Zero `SQLITE_SCHEMA` warnings under concurrent reads + admin DDL

**Requirement ref:** REQ-019
**Test id:** T-021
**Assertion:** A workload mixing 8 concurrent reader threads with 1 admin DDL operation/sec for 60 s emits zero events with `code == SQLITE_SCHEMA`.
**Measurement:** Subscribe to error stream; run fixture (DDL operations enumerated: `admin.configure_kind` add + remove cycle, schema-projection rebuild); assert event count = 0.
**Fixture:** schema-flood fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending — must enumerate DDL operations under test).

## AC-022a: Engine close releases lock

**Requirement ref:** REQ-020a
**Test id:** T-022a
**Assertion:** After `Engine.close()` returns, the database file's exclusive lock is released and a sibling process can acquire it.
**Measurement:** Sibling process attempts open-and-acquire-lock immediately after close-return in parent; assert sibling succeeds within 1 s.
**Fixture:** parent-child-process fixture.

## AC-022b: Engine close does not leak FDs

**Requirement ref:** REQ-020a
**Test id:** T-022b
**Assertion:** Post-close FD count for the host process is ≤ pre-open FD count + P-FD-TOL.
**Measurement:** Capture pre-open + post-close FD count; assert bound.
**Fixture:** open-close fixture.

## AC-022c: Host process exits ≤ 5 s of close

**Requirement ref:** REQ-020b
**Test id:** T-022c
**Assertion:** A host process whose only work is `Engine.open(); Engine.close()` exits within 5 s of `close()` returning.
**Measurement:** Spawn subprocess; time from close-return to process-exit; assert ≤ 5 s.
**Fixture:** open-close subprocess.

## AC-023a: Bounded process exit ≤ 5 s on main-return without explicit close

**Requirement ref:** REQ-021
**Test id:** T-023a
**Assertion:** A subprocess that opens an engine, drops the local handle, and returns from main exits within 5 s.
**Measurement:** Time from main-return to process-exit; assert ≤ 5 s.
**Fixture:** open-no-close-handle-dropped subprocess.

## AC-023b: Bounded process exit ≤ 5 s on main-return with engine in module-level global

**Requirement ref:** REQ-021
**Test id:** T-023b
**Assertion:** A subprocess that opens an engine bound to a module-level global (handle never explicitly dropped) and returns from main exits within 5 s.
**Measurement:** Time from main-return to process-exit; assert ≤ 5 s.
**Fixture:** open-no-close-global-held subprocess.

## AC-024a: `DatabaseLocked` rejection on second open

**Requirement ref:** REQ-022a
**Test id:** T-024a
**Assertion:** Opening a second engine on a database file held by a first engine raises a typed `DatabaseLocked` error within P-LOCK-BOUND, including while the first engine has pending vector work.
**Measurement:** Open A; enqueue 100 vector writes; attempt second open from sibling process; assert typed exception within P-LOCK-BOUND; repeat 10× for smoke.
**Fixture:** second-open-with-pending-vector fixture.

## AC-024b: Rejected second open never modifies file

**Assertion:** For each documented open-path corruption fixture in the 0.6.0 matrix `{WalReplayFailure, HeaderMalformed, SchemaInconsistent, EmbedderIdentityDrift}`, `Engine.open` returns `Err(EngineOpenError::Corruption(_))`. The engine never returns an `Engine` handle, never auto-truncates, never auto-rebuilds, never opens read-only.
**Measurement:** Run four fixtures, one per open-path `CorruptionKind`: WAL-replay corruption, header/page-1 corruption, schema-probe inconsistency, and corrupt stored embedder-profile row. Per fixture: invoke `Engine.open`; assert result is `Err`; downcast to `EngineOpenError::Corruption`; assert no `Engine` handle observable in caller scope; assert DB file mtime unchanged across the failed open (no truncation / no rebuild side effect); inspect process for absence of writer thread + scheduler.

**Requirement ref:** REQ-031d
**Test id:** T-035c
**Assertion:** After `Engine.open` returns `Corruption`, the exclusive WAL lock on `{database_path}.lock` is released (a fresh `Engine.open` from a sibling process succeeds against the same path, modulo the corruption surfacing again); no SQLite connection to the database is observably retained by the failed-open process; no fathomdb writer thread or scheduler runtime is running in the failed-open process.
**Measurement:** Trigger AC-035a fixture in process A; from sibling process B attempt `flock` (or equivalent) on the lock file → assert acquirable; in process A inspect open file descriptors → assert no fd points at the database file; inspect threads → assert no thread named per fathomdb writer / scheduler conventions.

**Assertion:** A pre-publish version-consistency check rejects any release where `Cargo.toml` workspace version and `src/python/pyproject.toml` version disagree.
**Measurement:** Run version-consistency check against synthetic mismatch; assert non-zero exit + named files. Run against match; assert exit 0.
**Fixture:** version-consistency fixtures.

## AC-054: Atomic multi-registry publish

**Requirement ref:** REQ-050
**Test id:** T-054
**Assertion:** The release-finalize script (named in `release-policy.md`) refuses to mark a release done while any one of the configured registry publishes (PyPI, crates.io, npm, GitHub Release) is in failed state.
**Measurement:** Inject a publish failure on one registry in a release-dry-run; assert release-finalize refuses to mark complete; assert a recorded failed-publish artifact exists.
**Fixture:** dry-run-with-injected-failure (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending; release-finalize script name pending in release-policy.md).

## AC-055: `sqlite-vec` validated at open with vector rows present

**Requirement ref:** REQ-051
**Test id:** T-055
**Assertion:** Opening a DB containing ≥ 1 vector row with `sqlite-vec` extension unavailable raises typed `VectorExtensionUnavailable` at `Engine.open` and aborts open before any read or write.
**Measurement:** Seed DB with 1 vector row; close; remove `sqlite-vec` shared library from load path; reopen; assert typed exception at open call (not at first vector query).
**Fixture:** vec-extension-removal fixture.

## AC-056: Registry-installed wheel is the release gate

**Requirement ref:** REQ-052
**Test id:** T-056
**Assertion:** The release-checklist script requires evidence (a recorded artifact path) of `pip install fathomdb==<version>` from PyPI in a fresh venv followed by an end-to-end open + write + search + close + process-exit script returning success, before marking the release done.
**Measurement:** Inspect release-checklist script source; assert it contains the install-from-registry step + the end-to-end smoke step + the recorded-artifact check; remove the smoke step in a fixture; assert release-checklist refuses to mark done.
**Fixture:** checklist-bypass-attempt fixture.

## Public surface

## AC-057a: Five-verb application runtime SDK surface

> **⚠ SUPERSEDED (0.8.0, Slice 25) by [AC-074](#ac-074-governed-sdk-surface--allowlist--parity--recovery-denylist--typedno-raw-sql-boundary).** AC-057a's "exactly five" verb-count **scope cap** was a development scaffolding device (`ADR-0.8.0-supersede-five-verb-surface-cap`, SIGNED 2026-06-03). It is retired in favour of a **governed, open** surface (allowlist-membership + cross-binding parity, not a count). The three load-bearing guarantees AC-057a bundled — SDK Py+TS parity, recovery-name unreachability, and the typed/no-raw-SQL boundary — are carried forward intact by AC-074. Kept as a forward pointer; **not deleted**.

**Superseded by:** AC-074 (governed SDK surface).
**Requirement ref:** REQ-053
**Test id:** T-057a
**Assertion:** The Python and TypeScript runtime SDK public application-command surface is exactly the canonical five-verb set in bindings-idiomatic casing: `Engine.open`, `admin.configure`, `write`, `search`, `close`; public data types, config types, and error classes do not count as application commands.
**Measurement:** Per binding: introspect the documented `Engine` and `admin` command callables; assert command set equality with the canonical five and assert no additional public application command callable exists outside the documented instrumentation/control methods.
**Fixture:** binding-introspection fixture.

## AC-074: Governed SDK surface — allowlist + parity + recovery-denylist + typed/no-raw-SQL boundary

**Requirement ref:** REQ-053
**Test id:** T-074 (`test_public_surface_is_allowlist`, `test_surface_parity_py_matches_ts`)
**Supersedes:** AC-057a (the "exactly five" scope cap).
**Assertion:** The SDK application-command surface is **governed, not capped** — a curated allowlist with cross-binding parity, a permanent recovery-name denylist, and the typed/no-raw-SQL boundary. Concretely, four falsifiable properties hold:

1. **Allowlist-membership (P1):** every *live* public application command in the Python and TypeScript SDKs is a member of the governed allowlist `{Engine.open, admin.configure, write, search, close, read.get, read.get_many, read.collection, read.mutations}` (B1 `read.*` namespace). The `read.*` members are documented-allowlist members shipping in 0.8.0 but go **live at Slice 30**; until then the live surface is a subset, so membership (not equality) is the binding check. Public data types, config types, error classes, and the engine-attached instrumentation/control methods (`drain`, `counters`, `set_profiling`/`setProfiling`, `set_slow_threshold_ms`/`setSlowThresholdMs`, `attach_logging_subscriber`/`attachSubscriber`) are **not** application commands and are not allowlist members.
2. **Cross-binding parity (P2):** the Python governed allowlist equals the TypeScript governed allowlist (membership-identical) — a verb appears in every SDK binding or in none.
3. **Recovery-denylist empty-intersection (P3):** the allowlist contains no name in `{recover, restore, repair, fix, rebuild}`. `doctor` is SDK-absent by **non-membership in the positive allowlist** (it is a CLI verb), **not** via this recovery denylist. The byte-frozen `test_no_recovery_surface.{py,ts}` / `no_recovery_surface.rs` remain the live enforcement of recovery unreachability (AC-035d / AC-058 unchanged).
4. **Typed / no-raw-SQL boundary (P4):** no public SDK entrypoint accepts raw SQL or a query DSL; reads take typed args + a small fixed filter grammar (equality + range over body-JSON). The typed-write boundary (`ADR-0.6.0-typed-write-boundary`) is untouched.

This AC **also binds the Rust facade** (`dev/interfaces/rust.md`) per the signed Q5 = BIND-RUST; the Rust-facade positive-allowlist/parity pin executes at **reserved-gap Slice 27** (it is additive governance and does not block Slice 30). The Python + TypeScript allowlist+parity rewrite lands here at Slice 25.

**Measurement:** Per binding, introspect the live public application-command surface (the `Engine` command verbs + the `admin` namespace callables, excluding data/config/error types and the instrumentation/control methods) and assert it is a **subset** of the governed allowlist constant `GOVERNED_SURFACE_ALLOWLIST`; assert the Python and TypeScript `GOVERNED_SURFACE_ALLOWLIST` constants are membership-identical (Slice 25.b byte-compares them); assert `GOVERNED_SURFACE_ALLOWLIST ∩ {recover,restore,repair,fix,rebuild} = ∅`; assert no public entrypoint exposes a raw-SQL parameter. **Rust-facade measurement (Q5 = BIND-RUST, landed Slice 27; tightened to the method level + feature-gated by Slice 27 fix-1):** the **default** (`operator`-feature-OFF) `fathomdb` facade re-exports exactly the governed Rust application-surface allowlist owned by `dev/interfaces/rust.md` (the 17 typed members — each resolved at compile time via `type_name::<…>()`, the operator-seam recovery/integrity/dump report types deliberately excluded), and — at the **method** level — exposes **no method whose name is in `{recover,restore,repair,fix,rebuild}`** (exact case-insensitive match; e.g. `rebuild_projections`/`rebuild_vec0` are gated off the default surface) and **no raw-SQL method** (`execute_for_test` is `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`, release-absent). It is parity-*consistent* with the Py+TS governed surface in posture (governed allowlist · recovery-denylist-absent · typed/no-raw-SQL) — NOT membership-identical, since the Rust facade is a different consumer contract (a type set whose verbs are `Engine` methods, not the Py/TS free-verb set). The operator/recovery seam (12 `Engine` methods + the 20 operator-seam re-exports) is feature-gated behind `operator`, which `fathomdb-cli` enables (gating, not deletion). Asserted by `src/rust/crates/fathomdb/tests/governed_surface.rs` (type allowlist + WITH-feature positive resolves) + the `compile_fail` method-absence doctests in `src/rust/crates/fathomdb/src/lib.rs` (default-build recovery-name absence; release-build raw-SQL absence) + the byte-frozen `src/rust/crates/fathomdb/tests/no_recovery_surface.rs` (the canonical Rust recovery-denylist pin).
**Fixture:** binding-introspection fixture (`test_surface.py` / `surface.test.ts`).

## AC-058: Recovery verbs CLI-reachable

**Requirement ref:** REQ-054
**Test id:** T-058
**Assertion:** The lossy recovery surface is reachable only via `fathomdb recover --accept-data-loss ...`; `fathomdb recover --help` documents every 0.6.0 recovery sub-flag in `{--truncate-wal, --rebuild-vec0, --rebuild-projections, --excise-source}`. (`--purge-logical-id` and `--restore-logical-id` deferred to 0.8.0 per HITL 2026-05-24; originally deferred to 0.7.x per ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope 2026-05-16 amendment — see `dev/roadmap/0.8.0.md`.)
**Measurement:** Invoke `fathomdb recover --help` (help output is human-facing and exempt from the non-help `--json` execution contract); assert each sub-flag name appears exactly once in the help output and that `--accept-data-loss` is documented on the root command.
**Fixture:** built CLI binary.

## AC-059a: `projection_cursor` exposed on read tx; monotonic non-decreasing

**Requirement ref:** REQ-055
**Test id:** T-059a
**Assertion:** Successive read-tx `projection_cursor` values across 1,000 sequential read-tx (with interleaved writes from a sibling thread) are monotonic non-decreasing.
**Measurement:** Run 1,000 sequential read-tx with interleaved writer thread; collect cursor values; assert `cursor[i+1] >= cursor[i]` for all i.
**Fixture:** interleaved-write-cursor fixture.

## AC-059b: Write commit returns write cursor satisfiable by `projection_cursor`

**Requirement ref:** REQ-055
**Test id:** T-059b
**Assertion:** A write commit returns a monotonic write cursor `c_w` such that the write's projection becomes queryable at the moment a read-tx exposing `projection_cursor >= c_w` is observable.
**Measurement:** Issue write W; capture `c_w`; poll read-tx until `c_r >= c_w`; immediately query for W's projection; assert present.
**Fixture:** write-cursor-projection fixture.

## AC-060a: Engine errors as typed language-idiomatic exceptions

**Requirement ref:** REQ-056
**Test id:** T-060a
**Assertion:** Every variant in the variant table of `ADR-0.6.0-error-taxonomy` § Decision maps to a distinct typed exception class in Python and a distinct typed error class in TypeScript; clients dispatch on the typed class without parsing error message strings.
**Measurement:** Enumerate variants from the ADR variant table; per variant, trigger via fixture; per binding: assert `except <SpecificError>` (Python) / `instanceof <SpecificError>` (TS) catches it; assert no message-string parsing required to distinguish.
**Fixture:** error-taxonomy-trigger suite (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending — one trigger per variant).

## AC-060b: JSON-Schema validation fires save-time, pre-commit; no open-time re-validation

**Requirement ref:** REQ-056
**Test id:** T-060b
**Assertion:** A `PreparedWrite::OpStore` whose payload fails its `schema_id`'s JSON Schema is rejected save-time with `SchemaValidationError` BEFORE any row is written or committed; the writer transaction is not opened, no partial state is observable post-rejection. Re-opening the database with `Engine.open` on a DB containing historical op-store rows whose payloads no longer satisfy the current `schema_id`'s schema (e.g. schema tightened in-repo between releases) does NOT trigger validation; open succeeds.
**Measurement:** (1) Submit `PreparedWrite::OpStore` with payload violating its schema; assert `SchemaValidationError` raised; assert sqlite tx counter unchanged + zero rows added to op-store table. (2) Seed DB with historical op-store row, tighten in-repo schema for that `schema_id` so the row would now fail, restart engine via `Engine.open`; assert open succeeds without error and no validation runs.
**Fixture:** json-schema-validation-cadence fixture (save-time-reject + open-time-skip).

## AC-061a: `append_only_log` writes preserve authoritative history

**Requirement ref:** REQ-057
**Test id:** T-061a
**Assertion:** Two accepted writes to the same `append_only_log` collection and `record_key` produce two distinct authoritative rows in `operational_mutations`; neither write overwrites the earlier row.
**Measurement:** Declare an `append_only_log` collection in fixture metadata; submit two `PreparedWrite::OpStore` writes with the same logical key and distinct payloads; query `operational_mutations`; assert row count increases by 2 and both payloads remain present in commit order.
**Fixture:** op-store-append-log fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-061b: `latest_state` stores one authoritative current row per key

**Requirement ref:** REQ-057
**Test id:** T-061b
**Assertion:** Two accepted writes to the same `latest_state` collection and `record_key` leave exactly one row in `operational_state` for that key, and that row's payload equals the second write's payload.
**Measurement:** Declare a `latest_state` collection; submit two writes with the same key and distinct payloads; query `operational_state`; assert exactly one row for that key and payload equality with the later write.
**Fixture:** op-store-latest-state fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-061c: No derived `operational_current` table exists

**Requirement ref:** REQ-057
**Test id:** T-061c
**Assertion:** A migrated 0.6.0 database schema contains `operational_collections`, `operational_mutations`, and `operational_state`, and contains no table named `operational_current`.
**Measurement:** Open a fresh 0.6.0 DB and inspect `sqlite_schema`; assert the three accepted table names exist and `operational_current` does not.
**Fixture:** fresh-migrated-db fixture.

## AC-062: Collection registry schema exposes the accepted narrow lifecycle

**Requirement ref:** REQ-058
**Test id:** T-062
**Assertion:** `operational_collections` exposes exactly the lifecycle-bearing columns `name`, `kind`, `schema_json`, `retention_json`, `format_version`, `created_at` and exposes no `disabled_at` or equivalent status / rename column.
**Measurement:** Inspect `PRAGMA table_info(operational_collections)`; assert the documented columns are present and assert absence of `disabled_at`, `renamed_from`, `retired_at`, and `status`.
**Fixture:** fresh-migrated-db fixture.

## AC-063a: Exhausted projection failure is recorded durably

**Requirement ref:** REQ-059
**Test id:** T-063a
**Assertion:** A projection batch that exhausts the fixed retry policy records exactly one durable failure row in the `projection_failures` op-store collection and leaves the corresponding vector projection absent.
**Measurement:** Use a deterministic failing embedder fixture; submit one vector-producing write; wait for retries to exhaust; query `operational_mutations` for collection `projection_failures`; assert exactly one new failure row for the batch and assert no vector row materialized for that batch's canonical row.
**Fixture:** projection-failure fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-063b: Restart does not silently clear terminal projection failures

**Requirement ref:** REQ-059
**Test id:** T-063b
**Assertion:** After AC-063a, closing and reopening the engine leaves the durable `projection_failures` row present and does not materialize the missing vector projection before any explicit regenerate workflow is invoked.
**Measurement:** Produce AC-063a failure; record failure-row identity; close and reopen; assert the same failure row remains in `operational_mutations`; query for the vector projection before any recovery command; assert still absent.
**Fixture:** as AC-063a.

## AC-063c: `recover --rebuild-projections` performs the explicit regenerate workflow

**Requirement ref:** REQ-059
**Test id:** T-063c
**Assertion:** Running `fathomdb recover --accept-data-loss --rebuild-projections --json` against the AC-063a fixture materializes the missing projection from canonical rows without requiring a second application write.
**Measurement:** Produce AC-063a failure; run the documented recovery command; reopen if required by implementation; query for the previously-missing vector projection; assert present and queryable.
**Fixture:** as AC-063a + built CLI binary.

## Security hardening (AC-064..AC-070)

Added 2026-05-02 as an HITL amendment to the locked corpus per
`dev/security-review.md`. Each AC closes a 0.6.0 security finding.

## AC-064: Op-store payload validation rejects ReDoS regex in bounded time

**Requirement ref:** REQ-060
**Test id:** T-064
**Assertion:** Registering an op-store collection schema with `pattern: "^(a|a)*$"` and submitting a 30-char non-matching payload returns `SchemaValidationError` within 100 ms wall-clock; the writer thread is not stalled and accepts a subsequent benign write.
**Measurement:** `admin.configure` registers the catastrophic schema; one `write` call submits payload `"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab"`; assert `SchemaValidationError` raised in ≤ 100 ms; immediately submit a benign payload to the same collection; assert success.
**Fixture:** in-memory fixture; ReDoS-pattern schema fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

---

## AC-065: Op-store schema registration rejects external `$ref`

**Requirement ref:** REQ-061
**Test id:** T-065
**Assertion:** `admin.configure` rejects a schema whose `$ref` value is `http://example/`, `https://example/`, or `file:///etc/passwd` with a typed registration error; no payload validation runs, and no outbound network request or filesystem read is attempted by the engine.
**Measurement:** Three sub-assertions, one per scheme. Each: call `admin.configure` with the schema; assert error class is the typed schema-registration rejection; assert the engine made no DNS lookup, no socket open to the named host, and no `open(2)` of `/etc/passwd` (verified by side-channel, e.g., test-only network-deny harness + path probe).
**Fixture:** netns-deny-egress + bpftrace harnesses (already cataloged for AC-036/AC-037).

---

## AC-066: Wrong-dimension embedder return rolls back without vec0 write

**Requirement ref:** REQ-062
**Test id:** T-066
**Assertion:** A stub embedder returning a vector of length `dim - 1` (where `dim` is the configured embedder dimension) causes the in-flight write to fail with `EmbedderDimensionMismatchError`; the vec0 partition table for the affected source has zero new rows after rollback; a follow-up write with a correct-length vector succeeds.
**Measurement:** Open engine with stub embedder; submit one write; assert exception class; query `SELECT count(*)` against vec0 partition for the source rowid; assert unchanged. Replace stub with correct-dim variant; submit write; assert success.
**Fixture:** dimension-mismatch stub embedder (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

---

## AC-067: Rust panic in binding entry point surfaces as language-native exception

**Requirement ref:** REQ-063
**Test id:** T-067
**Assertion:** Triggering a forced Rust `panic!` inside a binding entry point (via a debug-only test hook) surfaces to the caller as a typed binding exception (`PanicException`-class in Python, `FathomDbError` subclass in TypeScript); the host process does not abort and remains usable for subsequent calls.
**Measurement:** Build engine with `cfg(test)` panic-injection hook reachable from a `force_panic_for_test` debug-only verb. Call from Python and TypeScript test runners. Assert exception raised, process PID unchanged, follow-up `engine.counters()` succeeds.
**Fixture:** debug-only panic-injection hook (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending). Disabled in release builds.

---

## AC-068a: FFI rejects embedded NUL in string arguments

**Requirement ref:** REQ-064
**Test id:** T-068a
**Assertion:** Submitting a write payload that contains an embedded `\0` in any string field (typed write or op-store payload) raises `WriteValidationError` from the binding layer; no SQLite bind happens, and no row is written.
**Measurement:** From Python and TypeScript: submit payload with `"a\0b"` in a text field; assert `WriteValidationError`; assert no new row in canonical or op-store tables.
**Fixture:** in-memory engine.

---

## AC-068b: FFI rejects unpaired surrogates in string arguments

**Requirement ref:** REQ-064
**Test id:** T-068b
**Assertion:** Submitting a write payload that contains an unpaired UTF-16 surrogate (e.g., `"\ud800"` from Python `str`, or the equivalent constructed-string from TypeScript) raises `WriteValidationError` from the binding layer; no row is written.
**Measurement:** From Python: `"a\ud800b"` in a text field; assert `WriteValidationError`. From TypeScript: equivalent constructed string via `String.fromCharCode(0xd800)`; assert `WriteValidationError`.
**Fixture:** in-memory engine.

---

## AC-068c: Python `engine.open_report()` surfaces structured open report

**Requirement ref:** REQ-064
**Test id:** T-068c
**Assertion:** Python `engine.open_report()` returns the structured open report captured at `Engine.open` time. Caller receives every field of the native `OpenReport` struct (`src/rust/crates/fathomdb-engine/src/lib.rs:541-548`) under the same snake_case identifiers: `schema_version_before: int`, `schema_version_after: int`, `migration_steps: list`, `embedder_warmup_ms: int`, `query_backend: str`, and `default_embedder` (embedder-identity payload). The accessor is idempotent — repeat calls return identical data (the report is a snapshot, not live state). `Engine.open(...)` signature unchanged from 0.6.0 (returns just `Engine`); no return-shape regression.
**Measurement:** From Python: open a fresh DB; call `engine.open_report()` twice; assert every field populated AND identical across calls. Cites `dev/design/engine.md` § "`Engine.open` success result" (spec-locked field subset: `schema_version_before`, `schema_version_after`, `migration_steps`, `embedder_warmup_ms`) and `dev/interfaces/python.md` (Engine-attached instrumentation list, post-spec-edit).
**Fixture:** in-memory engine (per-test `tmp_path` per `src/python/tests/conftest.py`).

---

## AC-068d: TypeScript `engine.openReport()` surfaces structured open report

**Requirement ref:** REQ-064
**Test id:** T-068d
**Assertion:** TypeScript `engine.openReport()` returns the structured open report (sync return — data lives in the napi engine struct after open). Caller receives the camelCase mirror of the native fields: `schemaVersionBefore: number`, `schemaVersionAfter: number`, `migrationSteps: ReadonlyArray<MigrationStepReport>`, `embedderWarmupMs: number`, `queryBackend: string`, `defaultEmbedder` (embedder-identity payload). Idempotent — repeat calls return identical data. `Engine.open(...)` Promise signature unchanged from 0.6.0 (resolves to just `Engine`).
**Measurement:** From TypeScript: open a fresh DB; call `engine.openReport()` twice; assert every field populated AND identical across calls. Cites `src/rust/crates/fathomdb-engine/src/lib.rs:541-548` and `dev/interfaces/typescript.md` (Engine-attached instrumentation list, post-spec-edit).
**Fixture:** in-memory engine (per-test temp path per `src/ts/tests/` conventions).

---

## AC-069: Error `Display` omits raw SQL, absolute paths, and parser byte offsets

**Requirement ref:** REQ-065
**Test id:** T-069
**Assertion:** Across `EngineError` and `EngineOpenError` variants whose foreign cause carries SQL, absolute path, or byte-offset content, the `Display` (and `__str__` / `.message`) output contains none of those three fields.
**Measurement:** Construct three foreign-cause fixtures: (1) `rusqlite::Error` with a SQL fragment; (2) `io::Error` with absolute path `/tmp/<random>/db.sqlite`; (3) `serde_json::Error` with a known byte offset. Wrap each in the appropriate engine error variant. Assert `Display` output contains zero substring matches against the SQL fragment, the absolute path, and the byte-offset literal.
**Fixture:** in-process foreign-cause fixtures (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

---

## AC-070: Failed migration preserves prior `user_version`

**Requirement ref:** REQ-066
**Test id:** T-070
**Assertion:** When a registered migration step is forced to fail mid-execution, `Engine.open` returns `MigrationError`; the database's `PRAGMA user_version` after the failed open equals the value held before the open attempt.
**Measurement:** Open a fresh DB at user_version `N`; register a migration to `N+1` whose body contains a forced failing statement before the user_version bump; call `Engine.open`; assert `MigrationError`; reopen via a side-channel (or read user_version directly via raw rusqlite without the engine); assert `PRAGMA user_version` == `N`.
**Fixture:** failing-migration fixture (test-plan.md fixture spec — pending).

## AC-072: Vector retrieval latency (revised, tiered) — supersedes the AC-013 budget

**Requirement ref:** REQ-011
**Test id:** T-013 (`perf_gates::ac_013_vector_retrieval_latency`) + per-push canary `perf_gates::ac_013_vector_read_path_smoke`
**Supersedes:** the AC-013 numeric budget (legacy `ADR-0.6.0-retrieval-latency-gates`: p50 ≤ 50 / p99 ≤ 200 ms). HITL-locked 2026-06-01 (0.7.2 PR-3) per `ADR-0.7.0-text-query-latency-gates-revised`.
**Assertion (tiered by corpus size N; the binding release gate for the 0.x and 1.x lines is the 10k tier):**

- **10,000-row tier — BINDING:** p50 ≤ 80 ms AND p99 ≤ 300 ms over ≥ P-PERF-SAMPLES samples. MET (real bge p50 36 / p99 49 ms at N≈7,667; synthetic 384-d 15/17 ms).
- **100,000 / 1,000,000 tiers — TRACKED, not gated:** same 80/300 target, deferred to post-1.0 (pre-2.1) ANN-index work — the vec0 bit-KNN is a per-query O(N) linear scan. Measured 100k ≈ 147 ms p50; 1M ≈ 1.5 s (O(N) extrapolation). See `dev/design/ann-index-vec0.md`.
**Measurement:** LOCAL once-per-release exercise (real-embedder canonical N=1M is infeasible on CI — ~166 h seed at 1.67 docs/s vs a 240-min timeout); per-push CI runs only the FTS-isolated read-path smoke. In code the budget is asserted only at `n ≤ AC013_GATE_N` (10,000); larger N is reported (`AC013_TIER_INFO`). Full data: `dev/plans/runs/0.7.2-PR-3-perf-data.md`.
**Fixture:** real-corpus (`data/corpus-data`) via `eu7_real_corpus_ac.rs` for the verdict anchor; synthetic `VaryingEmbedder` in `perf_gates` for the gate + smoke.

## AC-073: Mixed-retrieval stress tail (revised, tiered) — supersedes the AC-019 budget

**Requirement ref:** REQ-017
**Test id:** T-019 (`perf_gates::ac_019_mixed_retrieval_stress_workload_tail`, REPORT-ONLY) + `eu7_real_corpus_ac.rs` (asserting verdict). Conditional on AC-072.
**Supersedes:** the AC-019 budget basis. HITL-locked 2026-06-01 (0.7.2 PR-3) per `ADR-0.7.0-text-query-latency-gates-revised`.
**Assertion (tiered; binding = 10k tier):** stress p99 ≤ `max(P-STRESS-MULT × baseline_p99, P-STRESS-FLOOR)` measured on the REAL-corpus path (the verdict-quality signal). MET at the 10k tier: clean run 343 ms < 405 ms bound (N≈7,667). 100k/1M tracked post-1.0 (inherit AC-072's O(N) growth).
**Measurement:** the real-corpus harness is the verdict; the synthetic `perf_gates` AC-019 is REPORT-ONLY (`AC019_REPORT_ONLY`) — its instant-embed baseline makes the baseline-relative 10× bound unmeetable by the synthetic data (a fixture property, not a regression). See `dev/plans/runs/0.7.2-PR-3-perf-data.md`.
**Fixture:** real-corpus (`eu7_real_corpus_ac.rs`) for the verdict; synthetic mixed-retrieval-stress in `perf_gates` for scouting.

## AC-075: Recall@10 verdict (real-embedder, ANN+ vector stage) — supersedes the informal AC-013b floor assert

**Requirement ref:** REQ-011
**Test id:** `eu7_real_corpus_ac.rs` (ASSERTING verdict, real bge-small, measured on the pre-fusion vector stage via `set_vector_stage_only_for_test`) + `perf_gates::ac_013b_recall_at_10_floor` (REPORT-ONLY, synthetic fidelity) + `perf_gates::ac_013b_floor_matches_adr` (fast sentinel). Conditional on AC-072.
**Supersedes:** the informal AC-013b floor assertion (the synthetic `ac_013b_recall_at_10_floor` previously hard-asserted 0.90 on an isotropic `VaryingEmbedder` — the asserting gate ran on the wrong fixture). HITL-approved 2026-06-06; ◆ B-1 ruling (Option 1) 2026-06-08; minted at the 0.8.0 GA gated slice (Slice 40).
**Assertion:** `eu7` real-corpus recall@10 of the **ANN+ vector stage** (1-bit sign-quant K=192 Hamming + f32 rerank) vs the **exact-f32 VECTOR top-10** of the same embedder ≥ **0.90** — an ANN-quantization **FIDELITY** gate, measured on the **vector stage in isolation** (NOT the RRF-fused `search()` output). MET: bge-small over the real corpus (N≈7,667, K=192) measures vector-stage recall@10 = **0.937** (bootstrap CI 0.913–0.957, σ 0.0116) — full CI clears 0.90. **◆ B-1 rationale:** the eu7 ground truth is a vector-only top-10, but Slice 10 (`d28d204`) made `search()` unconditional RRF-hybrid (vector ⊕ FTS5); measuring a hybrid result against a vector-only GT conflated quantization fidelity with intended fusion divergence (the Slice-40 Phase-A HALT, recall 0.8710; see `dev/plans/runs/GA-1-corpus-ab-20260608T012503Z.md`). The fused-`search()` recall (~0.871) is reported as the report-only delta `EU7_RECALL_FUSED`. The synthetic `ac_013b` is demoted to a REPORT-ONLY quantization-fidelity signal (`RECALL_FIDELITY_INFO`, ~0.73–0.89 on isotropic noise — the noise-limited worst case for sign-bit ANN, not a product floor); the `AC013B_RECALL_FLOOR = 0.90` constant and its sentinel are retained.
**0.8.0 GA-3 asserting form (◆ HITL ruling 2026-06-08; CI-based reconciliation, floor target 0.90 UNCHANGED):** the 0.8.0 eu7 asserting verdict is "real-embedder eu7 vector-stage recall@10 whose **95% bootstrap CI is not significantly below 0.90** (`recall_ci_hi >= 0.90`)" — a **one-sided** gate (not a two-sided "floor ∈ [ci_lo, ci_hi]" test, which would wrongly fail a comfortably-high recall whose whole CI clears the floor). The prior point-estimate hard-assert (`recall >= 0.90`) PANICKED at the measured N=7667 result; the floor **constant stays 0.90** (`CURRENT_FLOOR`/`AC013B_RECALL_FLOOR` unchanged — not lowered). **Measured result satisfies the gate:** point estimate **0.896**, CI **[0.864, 0.925]** → ci_hi **0.925 ≥ 0.90 ⇒ PASS** (within measurement uncertainty / "rounding-error territory" per the HITL ruling — the 0.90 floor lies inside the 95% CI). The **point-estimate-≥0.90 recovery** and the **~4pt 0.7.x→0.8.0 vector-stage drop** (0.937→0.896) diagnosis are **0.8.1** items. This CI-form is a **0.8.0-scoped reconciliation to be REVISITED after 0.8.0**. Predicate `recall_ci_clears_floor` in `tests/support/recall_gate.rs`, asserted in `eu7_real_corpus_ac.rs`, unit-demonstrated (pass-at-recorded / bite-below-floor) in `tests/ga2_vector_stage_seam.rs`. (The 0.937 cited above is the superseded 0.7.x-inferred number; the real 0.8.0 re-measure is 0.896 — see `dev/plans/runs/GA-signoff-eu7-remeasure-20260608T172804Z.json` + STATUS-0.8.0 § 7.)
**Complementarity:** this FIDELITY gate is **complementary to and NOT a substitute for** the IR/relevance axis (eu8 IR ceiling ≈0.571, embedder-bound; the IR-1 `dev/plans/prompts/ir-recall-measure.md` initiative). Fidelity ≫ relevance ceiling, so this gate measures system health (does the quantized index preserve the f32 vector order), not product relevance.
**Measurement:** LOCAL once-per-release exercise (real-embedder canonical N is infeasible on CI — ~166 h bge seed at canonical scale, see AC-072); per-push CI runs only `perf_gates::ac_013_vector_read_path_smoke` (fixture-independent read-path canary). `eu7` is `AGENT_LONG` + `default-embedder`-gated. Amends `ADR-0.7.0-vector-binary-quant.md` § 2 point 4 (floor now GATED on the real-embedder eu7 vector stage, not the synthetic ac_013b).
**Fixture:** real-corpus (`data/corpus-data`) via `eu7_real_corpus_ac.rs` for the verdict; synthetic `VaryingEmbedder` in `perf_gates` for the reported fidelity signal + smoke.

## AC-076: Text-query latency (revised, tiered) — supersedes the AC-012 unconditional budget

**Requirement ref:** REQ-010
**Test id:** T-012 (`perf_gates::ac_012_text_query_latency_on_fts5_path`, tiered) + per-push canary `perf_gates::ac_013_vector_read_path_smoke`.
**Supersedes:** the AC-012 unconditional 100k budget (legacy: p50 ≤ 20 / p99 ≤ 150 ms asserted at `AC012_DEFAULT_N = 100_000`). HITL-ruled 2026-06-07; minted at the 0.8.0 GA gated slice (Slice 40). AC-012 retained as the legacy budget basis.
**Assertion (tiered by corpus size N; the binding release gate for the 0.x and 1.x lines is the 10k tier):**

- **10,000-row tier — BINDING:** p50 ≤ 20 ms AND p99 ≤ 150 ms over ≥ P-PERF-SAMPLES samples.
- **100,000 / 1,000,000 tiers — TRACKED, not gated:** same 20/150 target, deferred to post-1.0. The T-012 fixture invokes hybrid `Engine::search`, whose FTS arm retains full matched-row materialization and O(N) corpus scaling. The separate direct-text API now uses bounded rank-boundary collection when eligible; that implementation choice does not revise this threshold or retroactively change the T-012 evidence. HITL accepts the ~1 ms-over at the tracked 100k tier.
**Measurement:** LOCAL once-per-release / `perf-canonical.yml` dispatch (`--release`, isolated). In code the budget is asserted only at `n ≤ AC012_GATE_N` (10,000); larger N is reported (`AC012_TIER_INFO`), mirroring `ac_013`'s `AC013_GATE_N` branch. The measured hybrid path remains O(N) corpus-scaling, **not** the porter tokenizer — Slice 6 engine A/B showed porter ≈ unicode61 within noise, so the Slice-5 tokenizer upgrade is kept. The 0.8.24 direct-text rank-boundary selection adds no new canonical performance threshold and requires no confirming benchmark. Full data: `dev/plans/runs/0.8.0-slice-6-tokenizer-experiment-20260607T003001Z.md`.
**Fixture:** synthetic Zipfian corpus (`seed_ac012_corpus`) in `perf_gates`.

Test-plan.md does NOT decide thresholds. If a fixture / harness
generates a number (e.g. baseline*p99 in AC-019), that number is a
\_measured* value, not a _threshold_ — thresholds are compared against
measurements per the parameter table.

> **Status: RESERVED PLACEHOLDER — not yet a gate; no fabricated numbers.** **AC-077 is

> after AC-075/076 land at the Slice-40 merge — verify AC-076 is the max before minting). The

## AC-079: Signed 0.8.20 governed-surface delta

**Requirement ref:** R-20-AC / REQ-053
**Test id:** T-079 (`test_public_surface_is_allowlist`, `test_surface_parity_py_matches_ts`, `governed_surface`, `no_recovery_surface`)
**Mirrors:** AC-074.
**Status:** HITL-SIGNED — the accumulated delta was pre-signed 2026-07-25 and the batched decision was signed 2026-07-29 (steward seq-157); minted at Slice 40. The permitted 2026-08-01 `_comment` correction is re-signed by HITL seq-232 and leaves the governed arrays byte-identical.
**Assertion:** The governed SDK surface remains governed rather than capped. Four falsifiable properties hold:

1. **P1, allowlist membership:** every live public Python and TypeScript application command is a member of `src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json`; its counts remain exactly 30 `allowlist`, 5 `core`, and 5 `recovery_denylist` members.
2. **P2, Python/TypeScript parity:** the Python and TypeScript governed command sets are membership-identical.
3. **P3, recovery denylist:** `allowlist ∩ {recover, restore, repair, fix, rebuild} = ∅`; `excise_source` remains CLI-only and unallowlisted.
4. **P4, typed boundary:** no public SDK entrypoint accepts raw SQL or an arbitrary query DSL; the typed-write boundary remains in force.

The signed delta is exactly seven net-new allowlist members, representing four logical verbs: `erase_source` / `eraseSource`, `read.crossed_boundary_since` / `read.crossedBoundarySince`, `configure_projections` / `configureProjections`, and `read.projections`. It also records the associated public types `EraseReport`, `SourceId`, always-present `ExciseReport`, `ReadView`, `BoundaryCrossing`, `ProjectionSpec`, `ProjectionDelta`, `ProjectionRole`, and `ProjectionDestructiveError`. The Rust facade is separately governed as its typed consumer contract; it is parity-consistent with, but not membership-equal to, the Python/TypeScript command set.

**Measurement:** run the binding introspection/parity suites, the byte pin `scripts/check-governed-surface-pin.sh`, and the Rust-facade governed-surface suite. The pin compares raw-byte hashes, member lists, and all 30 / 5 / 5 counts; the recovery denylist is independently fixed to the five REQ-054 names.
**Fixture:** `src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json` and its T1e pin.

## AC-080: Erasure completeness at rest

**Requirement ref:** R-20-E1, R-20-E5
**Test id:** T-080 (`erasure_completeness`)
**Assertion:** After erasure, the erased body is absent from every row-owned projection and from raw database and `-wal` bytes. The proof is registry-driven, includes `search_index_v2`, and asserts raw table contents/raw file bytes rather than search results. A retained control body remains present; WAL-truncation busy conditions surface typed incompleteness rather than a false success.
**Measurement:** run `cargo test -p fathomdb-engine --features operator --test erasure_completeness`; all ten tests must execute and pass.
**Fixture:** operator-feature erasure-completeness fixture with raw-table and raw-byte witnesses.
