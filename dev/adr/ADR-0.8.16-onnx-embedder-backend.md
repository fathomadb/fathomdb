title: ADR-0.8.16-onnx-embedder-backend
date: 2026-07-07
target_release: 0.8.16
desc: Adds a cross-vendor ONNX-Runtime BGE-small embedder (OrtBgeEmbedder) as a new impl Embedder in fathomdb-embedder. Slice 70 amends the report-bearing caller to EmbedderChoice::CallerWithDeviceResolution so OpenReport records the final ONNX session outcome. Reaches AMD ROCm / Intel OpenVINO / DirectML that candle cannot. Behind a new onnx-embedder feature; the thin default build and the in-library 1-bit query path are unchanged. Includes the candle<->ONNX equivalence-measurement plan that feeds the 0.8.18 #5 vector-equivalence tolerance.

# ADR-0.8.16 — Cross-vendor ONNX embedder backend (OrtBgeEmbedder)

**Status: SIGNED** (HITL coreyt, 2026-07-08 — Slice-0 gate). ONNX-equivalence measurement AC minted; Slices
10→15 may proceed. Design context: `dev/design/0.8.16-slice-0-f9-onnx-design.md` (§5 equivalence plan, §6
ONNX decision).

> **Historical record — Slice 70 supersedes this ADR for current runtime device policy.**
> This file preserves the 0.8.16 ONNX-backend decision and measurement history;

> authoritative current policy is
> [`ADR-0.8.23-dual-runtime-device-policy.md`](ADR-0.8.23-dual-runtime-device-policy.md)
> and its Slice 70 design. In particular, any older ambient-parser, default, or
> provider-selection wording below is historical context only.

## 1. Context

candle reaches only CPU / CUDA / Metal — **no ROCm / Vulkan / DirectML / OpenVINO** — so AMD and Intel
GPUs are unreachable through it. `fathomdb-embedder/Cargo.toml` already anticipates the fix: the
cross-vendor path is a separate `impl Embedder` (ONNX-Runtime). It was structurally out-of-band at its
0.8.16 landing, but is scheduled here — not early-OOB — because it is (a)
low-urgency reach-hardware and (b) it manufactures the cross-backend numeric-divergence hazard that
0.8.18's #5 vector-equivalence guard exists to catch, so the two land back-to-back.

## 2. Decision

- **`OrtBgeEmbedder` in `fathomdb-embedder`** (`mod ort_bge`, sibling of `candle_bge` / `nomic`), `impl
  Embedder` from `fathomdb-embedder-api` (`embed`/`embed_batch`/`identity`). Produces BGE-small vectors
  (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, dim 384, CLS-corrected pooling to match the candle reference).
- **Injection:** a report-bearing `OrtBgeEmbedder` caller supplies it via
  `EmbedderChoice::CallerWithDeviceResolution { embedder, device_resolution }`.
  The original 0.8.16 `Caller` injection had zero engine diff; Slice 70 adds
  the bounded engine report field so the resolved ONNX session/provider outcome
  is recorded once on `OpenReport`. The engine still never names a concrete
  ONNX embedder, and the `Default` variant stays candle-only
  (`open_default_embedder` unchanged), preserving the footprint invariant.
- **Feature gating:** a new `onnx-embedder` Cargo feature pulling optional `ort` (+ tokenizer/loader deps),
  mirroring `default-embedder`'s `dep:` gating so the thin `default = []` build stays ML-free (EMB-3
  wheel-size gate). No new dep in the default build.
- **Device selection (R-ONNX-2, amended by Slice 70):** ONNX uses the same strict
  `FATHOMDB_EMBED_DEVICE` policy as the default embedder: exactly `auto`, `cpu`, or `cuda:N`.
  `auto` may report a typed CPU outcome after CUDA is unavailable; `cpu` never probes CUDA; `cuda:N`
  fails open rather than becoming a CPU session. The retired shared `DeviceRequest` parser and its
  CPU/Metal/provider grammar apply only to the legacy reranker control, not embedding. Selection
  happens at `Engine::open` via config/env — not compile-only.

## 3. Equivalence measurement & interim guard (R-ONNX-1, R-ONNX-3 → 0.8.18 #5)

- **Measured (Slice 15):** candle-CPU reference vs `OrtBgeEmbedder` across a fixed deterministic probe set;
  metrics = cosine / L2 / max-abs element Δ **and the load-bearing 1-bit sign-quantization FLIP RATE**
  (the in-library query path is 1-bit Hamming, so the sign-flip rate is what actually threatens fidelity).
  Backend matrix candle-CPU × {ONNX-CPU, ONNX-CUDA, ONNX-ROCm/DirectML/OpenVINO as available}; re-embed on
  the 3090s (cuda:0/1, exclude K620) when there is GPU room. Full plan: design package §5.
- **R-ONNX-1 acceptance:** a fixture text → vector within a *documented* Δ of the candle CPU reference.
- **Interim guard (R-ONNX-3, documented not enforced):** **same-backend build-and-read** — vectors written
  by one embedder backend are read/queried with the SAME backend until 0.8.18 #5 enforces a tolerance.
  Mirrors the 0.8.14 eu7 CPU-same-backend policy (`649a8d45`).
- **Feed-forward:** the recorded Δ (esp. the flip rate) is the input the 0.8.18 #5 vector-equivalence
  tolerance is calibrated against — record it precisely (plan §3).

## 4. Consequences / non-goals

- **Footprint invariant intact:** ONNX is a caller-supplied OFFLINE-BUILD/EVAL backend behind the trait;
  the in-library 1-bit CPU query path is unchanged; the thin default build gains no dep.
- **eu7 / R-GATE:** the shipped default path (candle CPU) is unchanged ⇒ eu7 no-op for the default build.
  ONNX-written vectors are governed by the same-backend read discipline until 0.8.18.
- **X1:** ONNX is Rust-crate-internal; if no SDK verb is added, assert no-new-verb (as 0.8.14 R-X-1).
- **Non-goal:** wiring ONNX into the `Default` variant / making it the shipped default. Non-goal: enforcing
  a candle↔ONNX tolerance (that is 0.8.18 #5). Non-goal: non-BGE models.

## 5. Open items for HITL (Slice-0 gate)

1. Mint the ONNX-equivalence measurement AC (R-ONNX-1 tolerance + R-ONNX-3 recorded Δ).
2. Confirm the `ort` crate + version is acceptable for the offline/eval build surface (no default-build
   footprint change).

## 6. HITL rulings (2026-07-08) — items 1 & 2 resolved

- **`ort =2.0.0-rc.10` ACCEPTED** behind the optional, non-default `onnx-embedder` feature (open item #2).
  It is an eval-only opt-in with zero default-build footprint change. The eventual `ort` 2.0-STABLE bump is
  tracked as **TC-9** (code comment at the `ort` dep in `fathomdb-embedder/Cargo.toml`).
- **R-ONNX-1 asset = deterministic OFFLINE export**, NO build-time network egress for the model. The
  committed tooling `dev/tools/onnx/export_bge_small_onnx.py` (+ README) loads the PINNED bge-small
  safetensors from the local HF cache (same weights / revision `5c38ec7c…` as the candle reference) and
  exports a byte-deterministic `last_hidden_state` ONNX graph (Rust applies CLS pooling + L2-norm). The
  `.onnx` binary (~133 MB) is a generated eval asset written to a gitignored path (default
  `~/.cache/fathomdb/embedders/onnx/…`) and is NOT committed.
- **ORT runtime provisioning (Task B): OFFLINE, NO DOWNLOAD.** `load-dynamic` + an explicit `ORT_DYLIB_PATH`
  pointing at an on-host `libonnxruntime.so.1.26.0` (bundled in the fathomdb `.venv` onnxruntime wheel) is
  ABI-compatible with `ort =2.0.0-rc.10`; the R-ONNX-1 real-vector test passes on the ONNX CPU EP against it.
  No build- or eval-time ORT-binary egress was needed.
- **R-ONNX-1 real-vector test is now RUN (not `#[ignore]`)**: env-gated on
  `ORT_DYLIB_PATH`/`FATHOMDB_ONNX_MODEL_PATH`/`FATHOMDB_ONNX_TOKENIZER_PATH` (skips cleanly on CI without the
  asset), and verified passing locally on the CPU EP — 384-dim, finite, L2-normalized, deterministic vector
  via the `Embedder` trait, identity revision self-describing the asset digest.
