# Bindings — Design

## 0.8.26 current-profile additions

Rust, Python, and TypeScript expose one changed-in-place V1 actuation grammar
with the same five operation capabilities and compact receipt semantics. Thin
bindings normalize field spelling and validate conversion coherence; they do
not reinterpret prospective endpoint validation, digest/replay, lifecycle,
erasure, or projection behavior owned by `design/actuation.md`.

Graph evidence is an opt-in sidecar on the existing graph operation. Binding
conversion preserves distinct target and terminal-edge selectors and rejects
incoherent resolved identity fields. It does not turn point resolution into
ranked search or add a parallel graph API.

All bindings apply the schema-34 fresh-database admission rule and map a
noncurrent nonempty database to their typed incompatible-schema open error.
`data-plane-integrity` remains CLI-only and is absent from governed Python and
TypeScript surfaces.

This file is **cross-cutting**. It commits to invariants that hold _across_ every public binding (Python, TypeScript, CLI) collectively, plus the protocol that connects each binding to the underlying Rust engine. Per-binding signatures, examples, and error cases live in `interfaces/{python,ts,cli}.md`; this file does not duplicate those.

## 0. Value-test against `interfaces/`

Per `plan.md` Phase 3 step 4, `design/bindings.md` is written first to test whether it fills a role distinct from per-surface `interfaces/*.md`. Verdict: **distinct role; KEEP**. The following concerns are _properties of bindings collectively_, not statements about a single binding's surface, and have no clean home in any per-language interface file:

| Cross-cutting concern                                                                                                                   | Why not in `interfaces/<lang>.md`                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Canonical-operation parity (every live operation is present in both SDK bindings, with idiomatic spelling)                            | Per-surface files would each enumerate their own symbols; a parity claim across bindings cannot be expressed by any single file.                                                                                                                     |
| Error-mapping _protocol_ (one class per variant; typed attrs not stringified args; single rooted hierarchy; no string-pattern dispatch) | The protocol commitments are properties OF the bindings collectively. The mapping _matrix itself_ lives in `design/errors.md` (architecture.md § 2) and is cited from interfaces/\*.md; this file commits the protocol that any matrix must satisfy. |
| Async dispatch model and where Invariants A–D land per binding                                                                          | A property of the engine boundary expressed differently per language; the _protocol_ (e.g. "Promise edges live in TS only; Python is sync") is shared.                                                                                               |
| Embedder identity + cross-language consistency (same DB opened from Python and TS resolves the same `EmbedderIdentity`)                 | Multi-binding invariant; not a per-language signature.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Per-binding _signatures_ still belong in `interfaces/{python,ts,cli}.md`. This file commits to _protocol_, not to syntax.

## 1. Governed SDK surface invariant (allowlist + parity)

Both Python and TypeScript SDK public application-command surfaces MUST equal
the live canonical-operation set. The raw-byte-pinned signed source remains
`src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json`; its 69 historical member
tokens are not rewritten. `src/conformance/governed-operation-parity.json` is
the executable companion map that groups those tokens into canonical operation
identities and records each binding's locator and idiomatic runtime spelling.
The companion currently defines 44 live canonical operations.

The executable oracle introspects all governed command locations: package
exports, `Engine` static and instance methods, and the `admin`, `read`, and
`graph` namespaces. For each binding, the observed locator/spelling set MUST
equal the companion's live set: extra and missing commands both fail. A
`reserved` operation MUST be absent from both runtime surfaces. The companion's
flattened `signed_members` MUST exactly equal the signed allowlist, preserving
the signed bytes while removing aliases and casing differences from parity
comparison. The invariant has three permanent clauses:

- **Cross-binding parity.** The claim is symmetric _across SDK bindings_ (Python
  and TypeScript): a canonical operation is live in both bindings or in neither.
  Adding an operation requires updating both SDK bindings and the companion map
  together. Runtime spelling may differ only through the explicit per-binding
  mapping (`read.get_many` / `read.getMany`, for example).
- **Recovery-name denylist** (see below) — preserved verbatim.
- **Typed / no-raw-SQL boundary** — reads take typed args + a small fixed filter
  grammar (equality + range over body-JSON), never raw SQL or a query DSL.

Rust is a stable public facade contract. Under the signed Q5 = BIND-RUST it is
**also bound** by the governed-surface AC (AC-074); the Rust-facade
positive-allowlist/parity pin executes at reserved-gap Slice 27.
`interfaces/rust.md` owns the Rust facade shape.

CLI is a separate, non-SDK surface (per ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope, architecture.md § 1: "Does NOT mirror full SDK 5-verb surface"). CLI exposes a structurally distinct operator command set (`fathomdb doctor <verb>` and `fathomdb recover`). CLI parity with SDK is NOT required and NOT promised; adding an SDK verb does not imply adding a CLI command.

The SDK surface MUST NOT contain any name in `{recover, restore, repair, fix, rebuild}` (REQ-037, REQ-054, REQ-031d). These verbs exist exclusively on the CLI surface. (The `doctor` CLI namespace is likewise SDK-absent, but by virtue of the positive verb allowlist — it is never added to the SDK surface — not via this recovery-name denylist, so it is not a member of this set.)

REQ-030's bounded-completion surface is **not** a top-level SDK application verb.
It is an `Engine` instance method. The per-language method spelling is owned by
`interfaces/{rust,python,typescript}.md`; this file commits only that it must
not widen the governed application-command allowlist with an undocumented verb.

## 2. Lifecycle dispatch model

Each binding owns the dispatch model for its language. The protocol that connects them to the engine is shared.

| Binding    | Dispatch model                                                                   | Engine call shape                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Owning ADR                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python     | Sync surface (Path 1)                                                            | Direct PyO3 call into Rust; engine is sync; Python `asyncio` users wrap with `run_in_executor` (documented pattern, not first-party API).                                                                                                                                                      | ADR-0.6.0-python-api-shape; ADR-0.6.0-async-surface (Path 1 + Invariants) |
| TypeScript | Promise surface (Path 2)                                                         | napi-rs `ThreadsafeFunction` + TS binding-owned Rust handoff pool sized `num_cpus::get()`. Decoupled from libuv's `fs/dns/crypto` thread pool. TS may expose adapter-specific sizing control, but that control is owned by the TS binding runtime rather than the canonical engine-config set. | ADR-0.6.0-typescript-api-shape; ADR-0.6.0-async-surface (Path 2)          |
| CLI        | Sync subcommand entry; binary returns process exit code per ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope. | Direct sync call into Rust; same engine as SDK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope                                                       |

Async invariants A–D from ADR-0.6.0-async-surface manifest in every binding. The invariants themselves are owned by that ADR; this file commits only the _binding-side_ assertion that no binding exposes an escape hatch:

- **Invariant A (scheduler post-commit).** Cite ADR-async-surface § Decision. Bindings expose no escape hatch: bindings do not introduce additional locking around `write`, do not pre-dispatch scheduler work from the caller thread, and do not provide a "skip-scheduler" path.
- **Invariant B (engine-owned embedder thread).** Cite ADR-async-surface § Decision. Bindings expose no escape hatch: embedder calls always run on the engine-owned embedder pool, never on the binding's caller thread (Python GIL-holder, TS libuv worker, CLI main thread).
- **Invariant C (embedder-protocol no-reentrancy).** Cite ADR-async-surface + ADR-embedder-protocol. Bindings document this constraint in their `Embedder` impl docs; tests verify a buggy user-supplied embedder cannot deadlock the engine. Bindings expose no escape hatch (no "reentrant embedder" config flag).
- **Invariant D (eager model warmup + per-call timeout).** Cite ADR-async-surface § Decision (eager warmup at `Engine.open`; per-call timeout default 30s). Bindings expose no escape hatch: no cold-load path, no per-call-timeout override that disables the watchdog. Reporting of model-load duration is part of `Engine.open`'s structured result, the shape of which is owned by `design/engine.md`.

## 3. Error-mapping protocol

The Rust error variant set is owned by **`ADR-0.6.0-error-taxonomy`** (BEHAVIOR commitment). The variant→class mapping matrix (Rust variant → Python exception → TS error class) is owned by **`design/errors.md`** per architecture.md § 2 (which assigns the `errors` module to that file). This file commits only the _protocol_ claims that the mapping must satisfy.

Protocol commitments (apply to every binding):

- **One concrete class per variant.** Never a generic `EngineError` with a `kind` discriminator string. Tests dispatch on `except <Specific>` (Python) and `instanceof <Specific>` (TS) without inspecting messages. (REQ-056; AC-060a.)
- **Single rooted hierarchy.** Every binding's exception/error hierarchy roots at one base class (Python: `fathomdb.EngineError`; TS: `FathomDbError`) so callers can catch broad failures while still narrowing per variant.
- **Typed attributes, not stringified payloads.** Variant fields surface as typed attributes on the exception/error object, not as `args[0]` tuples or stringified blobs. The exact attribute spelling (idiomatic per binding) is owned by `interfaces/{python,ts}.md`; this file commits that the attribute exists and is structurally typed.
- **Stable dispatch key for `CorruptionError`.** `recovery_hint.code` (idiomatic casing per binding) is the stable dispatch key per ADR-0.6.0-corruption-open-behavior § 2; `recovery_hint.doc_anchor` is the doc pointer. Bindings do not flatten or stringify `recovery_hint`.
- **CLI is structural.** Each variant maps to a stable exit code + a structured stderr line carrying the variant's stable code (e.g. `recovery_hint.code` for `Corruption`). The exit-code table itself lives in `interfaces/cli.md`; the variant→exit-code authority is in `design/errors.md`.
- **Top-level Rust error type plurality.** The Rust surface exposes more than one top-level error type (`EngineError` for runtime ops, `EngineOpenError` for `Engine.open` per ADR-0.6.0-corruption-open-behavior). `design/errors.md` enumerates which top-level Rust types exist and how each variant routes to a binding class; Python and TypeScript expose one catch-all base while preserving distinct leaf classes.

Decision note:

- 0.6.0 uses one exported catch-all base type across Python and TypeScript.
- TypeScript's catch-all base is `FathomDbError`; every concrete leaf class in
  `design/errors.md` extends it.

This file does NOT enumerate the variant→class matrix; that authority lives in `design/errors.md` and is cited by `interfaces/{python,ts,cli}.md`. Per-language interface files do not duplicate the matrix.

## 4. Marshalling strategy

`PreparedWrite` (per ADR-0.6.0-prepared-write-shape) is the only typed shape the engine accepts. Bindings construct `Vec<PreparedWrite>` from idiomatic per-language inputs and never touch raw SQL.

| Direction                                                                                  | Boundary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Owning ADR                                                        |

JSON-Schema validation behavior (AC-060b) is invariant across bindings:
validation fires save-time, pre-commit, on the writer thread; failure surfaces
as `SchemaValidationError`; no open-time re-validation; bindings do _not_ run
their own pre-engine validation pass (single source of truth).

## 5. Embedder identity invariant

Per ADR-0.6.0-vector-identity-embedder-owned + ADR-0.6.0-embedder-protocol, vector identity is owned by the embedder, not by per-DB config. Cross-binding consequence:

- A DB written by Python with embedder identity `E` and re-opened by TypeScript MUST resolve the same `EmbedderIdentity`. Bindings do not pin or override identity at open.
- Identity-mismatch surfaces uniformly as `EmbedderIdentityMismatch` (per § 3 mapping). Bindings do not auto-rebuild on mismatch (consistent with ADR-0.6.0-corruption-open-behavior's no-auto-recover posture for open failures).
- A user-supplied embedder (Python or TS impl) declares its `EmbedderIdentity` per ADR-0.6.0-embedder-protocol Invariants 1–4. Binding-side bindings do _not_ synthesize identity from binding metadata; identity is the embedder's responsibility.
- REQ-047 (embedder version-skew detection) is satisfied at link/resolution time by the semver-pinned `fathomdb-embedder-api` trait crate (architecture.md § 1) plus the embedder-owned `EmbedderIdentity` carried in stored vectors. Bindings do NOT perform runtime version-skew checks; they consume the typed mismatch error surfaced by the engine.

## 6. SDK symmetry, CLI boundary, and config classes

Two different symmetry rules exist and must not be conflated:

- **SDK surface symmetry.** Python and TypeScript expose the same canonical SDK
  verb set. This is the hard parity rule from § 1.
- **Engine-config symmetry.** Engine-owned knobs named in `design/engine.md`
  must be reachable from every SDK binding in idiomatic form.

CLI is outside both parity claims. It is a separate operator surface and does
not promise flag-for-flag mirroring of SDK verbs or SDK config.

The engine-config symmetry rule applies only to knobs that change engine
behavior after the binding boundary. It does **not** apply to binding-runtime
mechanics that exist only to bridge one host runtime into the engine.

Examples:

- `embedder_pool_size` — engine-owned runtime knob; symmetry required across
  SDK bindings.
- `scheduler_runtime_threads` — engine-owned runtime knob; symmetry required
  across SDK bindings.
- Python `run_in_executor` usage — caller-side runtime pattern, not an engine
  knob.
- TypeScript `ThreadsafeFunction` pool sizing — TS binding runtime mechanic per
  ADR-0.6.0-async-surface. A TS binding may surface it near `Engine.open`, but
  it is not part of the canonical engine-config set and does not create a
  Python-parity obligation.

CLI inherits engine defaults unless `interfaces/cli.md` explicitly grants a
flag. That inheritance posture does not weaken the SDK symmetry rule because
CLI is not an SDK binding.

## 7. Lock + process-exclusivity contract

Per `architecture.md` § 5 + ADR-0.6.0-database-lock-mechanism-reader-pool-revision (#31, supersedes #30), only one `Engine` instance per database file may be open at a time. The lock mechanism is the sidecar `{database_path}.lock` flock (Rust std `File::try_lock`, per-OFD exclusion semantics). Sidecar = pre-open fail-fast + operator-diagnostic PID + load-bearing layer for both cross-process and same-process two-`Engine` exclusion. The writer connection runs WAL with default (NORMAL) locking_mode; `PRAGMA locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE` is NOT applied — it is incompatible with the Phase 8 reader pool because EXCLUSIVE causes SQLite to skip the WAL shared-memory wal-index. Reader connections use default (NORMAL) locking_mode and benefit from WAL multi-reader concurrency (REQ-018). `-shm` is created as a normal WAL artifact.

Cross-binding consequences:

- Python in process A holding `Engine.open(path)` → TS in process B calling `Engine.open(path)` MUST fail with `DatabaseLocked { holder_pid }` regardless of binding identity. The sidecar flock is the load-bearing layer for cross-process exclusion; it surfaces BEFORE SQLite I/O begins, so Engine.open does not pay migration / embedder warmup cost on a doomed open.
- The lock's lifetime is bound to the `Engine` instance; closing or dropping the engine releases it (drops the sidecar lock fd + closes SQLite connections). `Engine.close` is required (REQ-020a; AC-022a).
- Same-process two-`Engine` (Python `Engine` and TS `Engine` in the _same_ process targeting the _same_ path) is also forbidden. The second `Engine.open` opens a NEW `File` handle for the sidecar; per-OFD `flock` semantics return `WouldBlock`, surfacing as `DatabaseLocked`. Bindings do NOT maintain an in-process registry of held paths.
- Path canonicalization: for an existing database, `Engine.open` resolves the
  complete path before deriving `{...}.lock`, so a final-component symlink and
  its target share one product-lock and recovery-sidecar namespace. A genuinely
  missing fresh path retains normalized-parent-plus-leaf identity; a dangling
  final-component symlink is refused rather than bootstrapped. Bindings do not
  perform their own canonicalization.

The corruption-on-open path (ADR-0.6.0-corruption-open-behavior § 5; AC-035c) MUST release the sidecar lock + close any opened SQLite connection before returning `CorruptionError`. Bindings inherit this guarantee; no binding-level workaround is permitted.

## 8. Logging / tracing subscriber attachment

The engine emits structured tracing events (per `dev/design-logging-and-tracing.md` Tier 1/2 carryovers). Binding adapters attach a host subscriber:

- Python: caller registers a `logging`-backed adapter via a binding-provided helper that maps tracing events into Python `LogRecord`s.
- TypeScript: caller registers a callback invoked per event.
- CLI: when run in human-facing mode, attaches a console subscriber; when run in machine-facing `--json` mode, emits the verb-owned JSON shape from `interfaces/cli.md` / `design/recovery.md`. `doctor check-integrity` is a single JSON object; other verbs own their own machine-readable contract.

Across bindings, the _engine event payload_ is wire-stable: same field names,
same types, same lifecycle phase tag enum (AC-001). The host adapter MAY
translate or derive **host-native required fields** from the engine event when
the host logger backend requires them. Engine event fields appear under a
stable `fathomdb` payload key in the host record so downstream filters can
target them precisely; the engine never emits a host-named field directly.

### `fathomdb` payload envelope

Within the host record, the stable `fathomdb` payload key carries one of these
surface shapes:

- response-cycle event: `phase` plus producer-owned operation context
- diagnostic event: `source`, `category`, and producer-owned detail payload
- counter snapshot: `counter_snapshot`
- profile record: `profile_record`
- stress-failure payload: `stress_failure`
- migration step event: `migration_step`

Ownership split:

- `design/lifecycle.md` owns `phase`, `source`, `category`,
  `counter_snapshot`, `profile_record`, and `stress_failure`
- `design/migrations.md` owns `migration_step`
- binding adapters own how these are embedded into host-native logger records

Acceptance note: current ACs lock the typed payload members more directly than
the outer `fathomdb` envelope key. Do not rename the envelope key without
updating both this file and the interface docs.

Default subscriber posture: when no subscriber is registered, the engine writes nothing — no log files, no stderr noise (AC-002).

## 9. Build / packaging strategy

Binding-shipping protocol — the canonical build entry point per binding. (CI smoke gates and post-publish verification are owned by `design/release.md` per architecture.md § 2; this file commits only the per-binding build path.)

| Binding    | Build path                                                                                | Authoritative source                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python     | `pip install -e src/python/` (PyO3 cdylib package `fathomdb` under `src/python/`)         | architecture.md § 1; memory `feedback_python_native_build` |
| TypeScript | `npm install` against `src/ts/` (napi-rs cdylib package `fathomdb` under `src/ts/`)       | architecture.md § 1; ADR-0.6.0-typescript-api-shape        |
| CLI        | `cargo build --release -p fathomdb-cli`; release artifact is a single binary per platform | ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope; ADR-0.6.0-tier1-ci-platforms          |

CI build, per-binding smoke testing, and post-publish verification (memory `feedback_release_verification`; AC-056) are owned by `design/release.md`. Developer ergonomics (e.g. "do not manually `cargo build && cp`") are out of scope here and live in `src/python/README.md` / contributor docs.

## 10. Recovery surface unreachability

The bindings collectively MUST NOT expose any recovery verb on the SDK surface. (REQ-037, REQ-054, REQ-031d; gated by AC-057a + AC-035d.) Recovery is invoked exclusively via the CLI binary `fathomdb recover` and `fathomdb doctor <verb>`. The application SDK contains no path that mutates a corruption-marked database.

This is a _non-presence_ claim, not a per-binding signature, and is therefore owned here rather than in `interfaces/{python,ts}.md`.

## 11. Failure modes + recovery

## 14. Invariants summary (no speculative knobs)

The bindings layer is normative on:

1. Governed SDK surface — a curated, parity-locked application-command allowlist (a verb appears in every SDK binding or none; no recovery on SDK).
2. Error-mapping _protocol_ (one class per variant; typed attrs; single rooted hierarchy; no string-pattern dispatch). The matrix itself lives in `design/errors.md`.
3. Dispatch model and Invariant A–D no-escape-hatch posture.
4. Typed write boundary across bindings.
5. JSON-Schema save-time validation cadence (no binding-side pre-validation).
6. Cross-binding embedder identity.
7. Engine-config knob symmetry across SDK bindings; binding-runtime mechanics
   like the TS dispatch pool are not canonical engine knobs.
8. Lock contract uniformity (sidecar flock per ADR #31, supersedes #30; writer connection uses default (NORMAL) locking_mode in WAL — EXCLUSIVE was dropped to admit the reader pool).
9. Logging engine-event payload wire-stability (host-native fields derived by adapter).
10. Recovery non-presence on SDK surface.

The bindings layer is _non-normative_ on (delegated to per-language `interfaces/*.md`): exact symbol names, parameter spellings, idiomatic casing, deprecation messaging, per-language documentation tone, hierarchy diagram presentation, ergonomic shortcuts that do not change semantics.

This file commits no knobs that are not already committed by an upstream ADR. It does not introduce a new `BindingsConfig` struct, a new dispatch model, or a new error class.

## 15. Followups out of scope here

- Subprocess bridge wire format (FU-WIRE15; ADR-0.6.0-subprocess-bridge-deferral; revisit 0.8.0).
- Embedder cancellation semantics (cited under ADR-0.6.0-async-surface followups).
- Asyncio-first Python API (not 0.6.0; sync is settled).
- Streaming result cursors across the FFI boundary (rejected for 0.6.0; results are owned/materialized per § 4).

## 16. Critic + lock protocol

Per `plan.md` Phase 3 step 4, this draft is critic-passed by `architecture-inspector` (cross-cutting design with strong ADR coupling). Findings applied; HITL gate before status flip to `locked`.
