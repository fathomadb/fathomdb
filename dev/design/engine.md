# Engine Design

This file owns the runtime open path, `Engine` lifetime, writer / reader split,
and the concrete meaning of the cursor values surfaced at the public API.

## 0.8.26 public-open boundary

The ordered 0.6.0 sequence below is a historical baseline, not permission to
migrate an arbitrary existing database. In 0.8.26, public open accepts only a
missing/zero-length path, bootstraps schema 34 through the internal schema
constructor, and then runs the normal runtime checks/startup sequence. Any
nonempty database whose `PRAGMA user_version` is not exactly 34 is refused as
`IncompatibleSchemaVersion` before product mutation.

Runtime SQLite configuration is applied before admission classification, so a
WAL-bearing earlier database is inspected under its actual journal semantics.
The persistent sidecar admission lock serializes competing first openers; the
older/noncurrent opener cannot race a fresh bootstrap into acceptance. Exact
behavior is owned by the accepted 0.8.26 breaking-boundary ADR and verified by
`slice40_fresh_database_cutover.rs`.

## Open path

Within an admitted database, `Engine.open` owns:

1. path canonicalization
2. sidecar lock acquisition
3. SQLite open + PRAGMA application
4. always-on corruption detection
5. schema bootstrap/validation (historical migration execution only in the
   locked baseline described below)
6. embedder identity check
7. embedder warmup
8. writer / scheduler startup

The detailed step ordering is aligned to HITL `ENG1`; this file is the
authoritative home for the final ordered sequence.

`Engine.open` runs only the frozen always-on detection subset from HITL `R1`.
0.6.0 exposes no env/config integrity knob at open and does not accept any SDK
config that turns quick/full integrity or round-trip verification on during the
open path.

The corruption-producing stages are the four `OpenStage` values owned by
`design/errors.md`:

- `WalReplay` for WAL replay verdicts (`E_CORRUPT_WAL_REPLAY`)
- `HeaderProbe` for page-1/header sanity (`E_CORRUPT_HEADER`)
- `SchemaProbe` for schema / migration-table consistency (`E_CORRUPT_SCHEMA`)
- `EmbedderIdentity` for corrupt stored embedder-profile rows
  (`E_CORRUPT_EMBEDDER_IDENTITY`)

`E_CORRUPT_INTEGRITY_CHECK` is not an open-path code. That code belongs only to
`doctor check-integrity --full` per `design/recovery.md`.

## `Engine.open` success result

On success, `Engine.open` returns the live engine handle plus a structured open
report.

The canonical success shape is:

- `engine`
- `report`

Where `report` carries at least:

- `schema_version_before`
- `schema_version_after`
- `migration_steps`
- `embedder_warmup_ms`

Ownership split:

- `design/migrations.md` owns `schema_version_*` and `migration_steps`
- this file owns the outer "engine handle + report" return contract
- `design/embedder.md` owns the semantics of warmup itself; this file owns the
  fact that `embedder_warmup_ms` is surfaced as part of open success

On migration failure, no engine handle is returned. The typed `MigrationError`
instead carries the migration-owned failure report described in
`design/migrations.md`.

## Writer / reader split

- One dedicated writer thread owns the only write connection.
- Reader connections are pooled and never serialize behind one connection.
- `admin.configure` is writer-thread work. It is not a side path and does not
  bypass the same lock, migration, or error rules as normal writes.

## `PreparedWrite::AdminSchema` provenance

`PreparedWrite::AdminSchema(AdminSchemaWrite)` exists because
`admin.configure` is already accepted public surface in 0.6.0 and its DDL work
must travel through the same writer-thread machinery as every other state
change. The variant is not speculative extension surface and must not be
deleted as "future admin work."

Why it exists:

- `admin.configure` is a top-level SDK verb under REQ-053.
- AC-003c and AC-021 already require observable admin work on the canonical
  engine path.
- ADR-0.6.0-prepared-write-shape commits to one typed carrier enum for writer
  submissions; admin DDL therefore needs an engine-side representation inside
  that carrier.

Status in 0.6.0:

- The existence of the `AdminSchema` variant is locked for 0.6.0.
- The exact field set of `AdminSchemaWrite` remains owned here and by the
  interface docs. It is still an internal engine carrier, not a promise that
  callers directly construct arbitrary DDL payloads.

## Canonical identity and supersession

Folded 2026-05-12 from archived `design-detailed-supersession.md` +
`design-id-generation-policy.md` per the Phase 1a learnings disposition
(`learnings.md:94, 98`). This section is the authoritative home for the
0.6.0 canonical identity contract.

### Identity model

Canonical rows separate physical row identity from logical entity identity:

- `row_id` — identifies one physical version of a node, edge, chunk, run,
  step, or action. Globally unique.
- `logical_id` — identifies the application entity across versions. Stable
  across supersessions. Required on `NodeInsert` and `EdgeInsert`; chunk /
  run / step / action use the single `id` field which is both physical and
  logical (these row kinds are not superseded in 0.6.0).
- The **active** version is the row for a given `logical_id` whose
  `superseded_at IS NULL`.
- A partial unique index enforces at most one active row per `logical_id`
  per kind.

Edges reference logical identities; traversals resolve to the current
active endpoint at read time.

### ID generation policy

Caller-owned IDs. The engine does not generate, assign, or sequence IDs as
part of the write path:

- Callers MUST provide `row_id` and `logical_id` on every `NodeInsert` and
  `EdgeInsert`.
- Callers MUST provide `id` on every `ChunkInsert`, `RunInsert`,
  `StepInsert`, and `ActionInsert`.
- Empty or duplicate-within-request IDs are rejected at `prepare_write`
  validation as a `WriteValidationError`, not at SQLite execution time.
- Cross-request uniqueness violations surface as the typed SQLite-mapped
  error per `design/errors.md`.

Rationale: caller-owned IDs preserve idempotent replay, keep the engine
stateless for ID sequencing, and let supersession address rows by stable
`logical_id` without a query round-trip.

The engine ships a standalone `new_id() -> String` utility (26-character
ULID) for callers that lack their own ID scheme. The utility is not part
of the write path; callers with existing identifiers do not need it.

### Write semantics under supersession

Each accepted batch executes one SQLite transaction (see "Batch submission
semantics" below). Within that transaction, supersession proceeds as:

1. Validate canonical rows and references.
2. Append new physical rows (nodes, edges, chunks, runs, steps, actions).
3. For each replaced `logical_id`, mark the prior active row superseded
   (`superseded_at = <commit timestamp>`); do NOT mutate the prior row's
   value columns.
4. Enqueue derived-projection invalidation for affected logical ids and
   kinds (FTS rows for retired chunks, vector rows for retired nodes).
5. Commit, or roll the entire batch back.

Supersession preserves both the old and the new physical row as separate
facts. The old row is marked inactive; its content is not rewritten.

### Restoration as a canonical write

"Restore a `logical_id`" means making a previously superseded physical row
active again. The 0.6.0 restoration operator (`Engine::restore_logical_id`,
recovery-only — see `design/recovery.md`) appends a new active row that
preserves restore provenance rather than mutating the historical
`superseded_at` column. The replay source is the op-store
`append_only_log` write history for the logical id (see
`design/recovery.md § Logical-id purge and restore`).

### Projection invariants

Projections follow canonical active state:

- FTS rows derive from active chunks; supersession retires the
  corresponding FTS row.
- Per-kind vector rows (`vec_<kind>`) derive from active nodes;
  supersession retires the corresponding vector row.
- A canonical row whose `superseded_at IS NOT NULL` has no derived
  projection rows for that logical id and kind.

Recovery tooling (`recover --rebuild-projections`, `--rebuild-vec0`)
rebuilds projections from the active canonical state, not from history.

## Batch submission semantics

`Engine.write(&[PreparedWrite])` is one ordered writer submission in 0.6.0.

The contract is:

1. The slice is validated as one batch before commit-sensitive work begins.
2. If any element fails save-time validation, the batch is rejected and no
   SQLite write transaction commits any member of the batch.
3. If validation succeeds, the writer executes the batch in caller order inside
   one SQLite transaction.
4. Mixed canonical rows and op-store rows in the same slice commit atomically.
5. One write cursor `c_w` is allocated for the committed batch as a whole, not
   per element.
6. Projection work derived from committed writes is enqueued only after that
   transaction commits.

0.6.0 does not regroup the slice by variant, split one slice into multiple
transactions, or expose partial-success semantics. The caller-visible contract
is "all committed at one cursor or none committed."

`admin.configure` uses the same writer machinery and transactional rules, but
it is a separate public verb from `write`; this file does not widen REQ-053
into a promise that arbitrary mixed admin-and-data batches are first-class user
surface.

## Cursor contract

Two distinct cursor concepts exist in 0.6.0:

- **Write cursor (`c_w`).** Returned on write commit. Identifies the accepted
  canonical write transaction.
- **`projection_cursor`.** Returned on read transactions. Identifies the latest
  projection-visible point.

Canonical and FTS visibility are immediate after the write commit. Vector
visibility catches up asynchronously. A caller that needs vector
read-after-write semantics polls until `read_projection_cursor >= c_w`.

This distinction is load-bearing for REQ-055 and AC-059b and must remain
consistent across `architecture.md`, `requirements.md`, `acceptance.md`, and
`interfaces/*.md`.

## `WriteReceipt`

`WriteReceipt` has exactly one public field in 0.6.0:

- `cursor`

No additional `WriteReceipt` fields are public contract in 0.6.0. Internal
batch bookkeeping may exist in implementation, but it must not leak into the
binding-facing receipt shape without an explicit design amendment.

## EngineConfig ownership

This file owns the canonical engine-config knob set and the rationale for any
publicly exposed tunables. A knob is not considered stable public surface until
it is named and justified here.

The canonical 0.6.0 engine-owned knob set is:

| Field                       | Type    | Default           | Owner note                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `embedder_pool_size`        | `usize` | `num_cpus::get()` | engine-owned runtime pool width                                                                    |
| `scheduler_runtime_threads` | `usize` | `2`               | engine-owned scheduler runtime width                                                               |
| `provenance_row_cap`        | `u64`   | `1_000_000`       | REQ-031 / AC-033 retention cap                                                                     |
| `embedder_call_timeout_ms`  | `u64`   | `30_000`          | invariant D watchdog default                                                                       |
| `slow_threshold_ms`         | `u64`   | `100`             | initial lifecycle slow-signal threshold; `set_slow_threshold_ms` mutates the live value after open |

Not part of the canonical `EngineConfig` set in 0.6.0:

- heartbeat cadence: configurable on the feedback/subscriber surface, not as a
  core engine-open knob; see `design/lifecycle.md` and `interfaces/{python,typescript,rust}.md`
- Python executor usage: caller/runtime pattern, not engine config

## Close path

`Engine.close` is the authoritative shutdown boundary for resources acquired
by `Engine.open`.

The close sequence is:

1. mark the engine as closing so new write/search/admin/drain work is rejected
2. stop scheduler admission and request cancellation of pending projection work
3. join scheduler runtime workers and embedder dispatch workers
4. drain or abandon in-flight projection callbacks without committing new
   projection rows after writer shutdown begins
5. stop and join the writer thread
6. close reader and writer SQLite connections
7. drop the sidecar lock file handle, releasing the engine-lifetime database
   lock
8. return to the caller only after no fathomdb-owned OS thread or database fd
   remains live

Lifecycle owns whether terminal feedback can be delivered for an observed
operation. This file owns the resource invariant: after `close` returns, a
sibling process can acquire the database lock and no fathomdb-owned SQLite
connection remains open.

- TypeScript `ThreadsafeFunction` pool sizing: binding-runtime mechanism, not
  canonical engine config

The interface docs own per-language field spelling for the canonical knob set.

## Debug-only runtime guard

The embedder-protocol `engine_in_call` guard is a debug-build deadlock
tripwire, not a user-facing contract surface.

- Purpose: catch re-entrant engine calls made from inside `Embedder.embed()`
  during development and CI.
- Behavior: debug builds may panic immediately when the guard detects
  re-entrancy.
- Non-contract: release builds do not promise a stable panic string, stable
  exception class, or a public configuration flag for this guard.

The stable 0.6.0 contract is the embedder invariant itself ("no engine
callbacks from `embed()`"), not the exact mechanics of the debug assertion.
