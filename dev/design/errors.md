# Errors Design

> **Requirement traceability (Steward, 2026-07-28; corrected after independent audit).** CONSULTED BY
> **`R-20-VC` / decision #18** (0.8.20 Slice 22) as the module error taxonomy. The Steward's audit recorded
> that this document did **not** name `InvalidArgument` anywhere and so could not by itself settle #18. That
> was true when written and is **no longer true**: Slice 22 settled #18 and, as part of the settlement,
> **added `InvalidArgument` to both the module-taxonomy table and the binding-facing class matrix below** —
> closing exactly the gap the audit identified. Retained here because the audit's reasoning still governs
> where the AUTHORITY lies: the literal statements are `dev/interfaces/rust.md:213-215` and `:352`; the
> variant was minted at `dev/design/slice-20-design.md:113`; the ruling ADR for the family split is
> `dev/adr/ADR-0.6.0-error-taxonomy.md` (accepted), whose per-module-vs-direct-variant rule is what makes
> the settlement correct — `WriteValidationError` is one of the module errors that ADR names, while
> `InvalidArgument` is a later-minted direct variant it never assigned to a module. Settling #18 changed
> this file's canonical class matrix **and** all of `dev/interfaces/*.md` (`AGENTS.md:25`; TC-39 records
> that obligation is routinely missed — it was met here; see the Slice 22 entries in each).
>
> **Requirement traceability (Steward, 2026-07-29).** Also CONSULTED BY **`R-20-SV`** (0.8.20 Slice 23) for
> the **`fts`/`vector` reject** — an `fts`/`vector` sub-object declared without the `searchable` role is an
> **invalid spec** (ruled 2026-07-24, `plan-0.8.20.md` §11 item 4) and must now raise, not accept-inert.
> **The family is already settled: `EngineError::WriteValidation`** (decision #18, Slice 22 — `lib.rs:3570`,
> used at `:2979`); the reject uses it and does **not** re-open that question. The one documented exception
> (`reject_unrenderable_edge_epoch`, an EDGE-EPOCH bounds check) is **TC-98, deferred by the HITL until
> after Slice 23** — it is a different validation path and does not gate this leg.
> **IMPLEMENTED in Slice 23**; the Validation-boundary section below now states the projection split
> explicitly (NAME rejections `InvalidArgument`, the sub-object SHAPE reject `WriteValidation`), which is
> the clarification this slice owed that section.

This file is the design owner named by `architecture.md` for the cross-cutting
error surface.

## Top-level types

- `EngineError` owns post-open runtime failures returned by `write`, `search`,
  `close`, scheduler callbacks, and op-store validation on accepted 0.6.0
  write paths.
- `EngineOpenError` owns `Engine.open` failures, including lock contention,
  incompatible schema, embedder-identity mismatch, and corruption-on-open.

Bindings map these roots into language-idiomatic class hierarchies per
`design/bindings.md`.

Top-level ownership boundary:

- `design/engine.md` owns when open-path stages produce `EngineOpenError`.
- Subsystem design docs own the semantics of their module errors.
- This file owns which module errors stay distinct, which top-level root they
  route through, and the stable machine-readable payload fields bindings may
  depend on.

## Module taxonomy

Per ADR-0.6.0-error-taxonomy, per-module errors stay distinct when they carry
different remediation or cross-doc ownership.

| Error type                      | Produced by                                        | Routed through    | Semantics owner         | Why distinct                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `StorageError`                  | canonical SQLite read/write path                   | `EngineError`     | `design/engine.md`      | physical storage / transaction failures are not projection or op-store failures |
| `ProjectionError`               | projection-row commit / terminal-state accounting  | `EngineError`     | `design/projections.md` | projection freshness and failure-state rules are distinct from canonical writes |
| `VectorError`                   | `sqlite-vec` encode/load/query path                | `EngineError`     | `design/vector.md`      | vector capability / encoding failures have vector-specific recovery             |
| `EmbedderError`                 | embedder dispatch, timeout, invalid vector return  | `EngineError`     | `design/embedder.md`    | caller remediation is "fix or replace embedder," not "retry generic write"      |
| `EmbedderRequired`              | pending embedding work with no configured runtime  | `EngineError`     | `design/0.8.23-embedding-configuration-feedback.md` | immediate typed configuration feedback; equivalence refusal and worker failure remain operational outcomes |
| `SchedulerError`                | scheduler startup/shutdown / queue orchestration   | `EngineError`     | `design/scheduler.md`   | queue and shutdown failures are not vector math or write-shape failures         |
| `OpStoreError`                  | unknown collection, kind mismatch, registry misuse | `EngineError`     | `design/op-store.md`    | op-store contract failures are separate from primary graph writes               |
| `WriteValidationError`          | malformed typed write shape                        | `EngineError`     | `design/engine.md`      | fix caller-submitted field shape / variant construction                         |
| `ProvenanceError`               | versioned identity/provenance validation or dependency refusal | `EngineError` | `plans/0.8.25/features/slice-15/design.md` | closed reason plus canonical JSON-pointer field path; distinct remediation from legacy write-shape failures |
| `InvalidArgument { msg }`       | caller-argument rejections OUTSIDE the write-validation boundary | `EngineError`     | `design/engine.md`      | carries an actionable message naming the offending argument; `WriteValidation` is a unit variant and cannot |
| `SchemaValidationError`         | JSON Schema rejection for op-store payloads        | `EngineError`     | `design/op-store.md`    | fix payload contents against registered `schema_id`                             |
| `EmbedderIdentityMismatchError` | open-time stored-vs-supplied identity comparison   | `EngineOpenError` | `design/embedder.md`    | open-time incompatibility, not runtime write/query failure                      |
| `MigrationError`                | schema migration execution                         | `EngineOpenError` | `design/migrations.md`  | open-time schema transition failure with per-step reporting                     |
| `VectorEquivalenceMismatchError`| open-time #5 probe divergence → query-time dense refusal | `EngineError` | `design/0.8.18-slice-5-vector-equivalence-probe.md` | dense retrieval refused because the live backend's re-embedded probes diverged; text-only/FTS-only path (`search_text_only`) stays serviceable |

`Overloaded` and `Closing` remain direct `EngineError` variants rather than
module errors because they are cross-cutting runtime states:

- `OverloadedError`
- `ClosingError`

`ProvenanceError` is also a direct `EngineError` variant. Its stable payload is
the closed lower-snake-case `reason` plus RFC 6901 `field_path`; TypeScript maps
the same payload to `reason` and `fieldPath` under `FDB_PROVENANCE`.

This file is the canonical home for the variant-to-binding mapping inputs and
the reason the named error modules exist at all.

## Validation boundary

The validation split is load-bearing and must not be collapsed in owner docs or
bindings:

- `WriteValidationError` means the submitted typed write is malformed before
  schema-sensitive payload checks run.
- `SchemaValidationError` means the op-store payload is structurally valid JSON
  but fails the registered `schema_id` JSON Schema at save time.
- `EmbedderIdentityMismatchError` is not a write-time validation at all; it is
  an open-time compatibility failure.
- `InvalidArgument` carries caller-argument rejections **outside** the
  write-validation boundary.

**The rule (2026-07-28 amendment, decision #18):** a malformed typed write SHAPE
at the write-validation boundary is `WriteValidation`; `InvalidArgument` carries
caller-argument rejections outside that boundary, plus the one boundary refusal
that must name the offending argument (below).

Concretely, every SHAPE rejection returned by the engine's `validate_write` is
`WriteValidation`: empty `kind` / `body` / endpoints, an empty or
record-separator-bearing `logical_id`, and — as of this amendment — an
unsatisfiable `[valid_from, valid_until)` window. `InvalidArgument` remains
correct for arguments that are not a typed write shape at all: an out-of-range
traversal `depth`, a malformed projection **NAME** or `drop` **NAME**, a
`ReadView` that relaxes an axis the verb does not permit.

**2026-07-29 amendment (0.8.20 Slice 23, `R-20-SV`) — the projection line above
said "a malformed `ProjectionSpec` / `drop` name", which read ambiguously as
either *a malformed ProjectionSpec, or a malformed drop name* or *a malformed
ProjectionSpec-name / drop-name*. Only the second reading is true of the code,
and it is now written that way.** Inside `apply_projection_config` the split is:

- **NAME rejections keep `InvalidArgument { msg }`** — an invalid projection
  attribute name, an invalid `drop` name, a name repeated within one request's
  `specs`, a `drop` entry repeated within one request. Every one of these names
  the offending value in its message, which is the caller's only handle on WHICH
  entry of a list-valued argument was refused.
- **The SHAPE reject is `WriteValidation`** — an `fts` or `vector` sub-object
  declared **without the `searchable` role**, ruled an invalid spec by the HITL
  on 2026-07-24 (`plan-0.8.20.md` §11 item 4, option (b)) and implemented in
  Slice 23. `searchable→FTS` / `searchable→vector` are tier labels: the
  sub-objects *select* a sub-target of `searchable` and do not *confer* one, so
  without the role the declaration builds, embeds and enrols nothing. This is a
  malformed submitted shape, so it takes the decision-#18 family. Pinned by
  `tests/slice23_spec_validation_reject.rs`, plus the Py/TS twins.

**Known cost of THIS reject, accepted and deferred (TC-95 / TC-98).**
`configure_projections` takes a **list** of specs, and `WriteValidation` is a
unit variant, so the refusal **cannot name which spec was invalid** — strictly
worse than the name rejections in the same function, which do. The HITL deferred
the message-payload question until after Slice 23; it is recorded here rather
than worked around, and the reject is implemented as ruled.

**Second known remaining inconsistency, flagged not fixed (0.8.20 Slice 23).**
`apply_projection_config`'s `"projection '<name>' declares no roles"` refusal is
a SHAPE rejection (an empty `roles` set is a malformed spec, not a bad name) that
still returns `InvalidArgument { msg }`. The rule above implies it should be
`WriteValidation`. It is **shipped behaviour and deliberately untouched**:
retro-classifying an existing rejection is outside `R-20-SV`'s scope, which is
the new reject only. Asserted as-is in
`tests/slice23_spec_validation_reject.rs::name_rejections_keep_invalid_argument_while_the_shape_reject_is_write_validation`
so the state of affairs is pinned rather than merely described.

**One NAMED exception inside the boundary, retained deliberately.**
`validate_write`'s Edge branch delegates to `reject_unrenderable_edge_epoch`,
which still returns `InvalidArgument { msg }` naming the offending field
(`t_valid` / `t_invalid`) and the epoch-seconds bound. That message is a
*required* contract, not an accident: TC-33 fix-1 (a codex §9 finding) exists
precisely because an unrenderable epoch renders to `null` on the consolidation
wire and silently resurrects an invalidated edge, so the refusal must tell the
caller WHICH field and WHICH bound. Collapsing it onto the message-less
`WriteValidation` would destroy that diagnostic, so decision #18 does **not**
touch it. It is pinned by `tests/tc33_fix1_unrenderable_epoch.rs` and asserted as
a documented exception in `tests/error_taxonomy.rs`.

So the honest statement of the settled rule is: **the write-SHAPE boundary is one
family (`WriteValidation`); the only `InvalidArgument` reachable from
`validate_write` is the edge-epoch range guard, and it is there because its
message is load-bearing.** Whether that exception should also collapse is
reserved for the follow-up that gives `WriteValidation` a message payload — after
which both can be one family with no diagnostic loss.

**Known cost of the collapse, accepted:** `EngineError::WriteValidation` is a
UNIT variant, and both bindings map it to a fixed, message-less string
(`WriteValidationError::new_err("write validation error")`;
`CODE_WRITE_VALIDATION` + `"write validation error"` + `data: null`). The
unsatisfiable-window refusal therefore **no longer names the offending bounds** —
the diagnostic the pre-amendment split existed to preserve. Restoring it requires
a message-carrying `WriteValidation { msg }`, a cross-cutting change across every
engine and binding raise site plus both binding payload shapes; that is tracked
separately and is deliberately **not** part of this amendment.

**Known remaining inconsistency, flagged not fixed:**
`Engine::excise_collection_record` has the same two-family split shape
(`WriteValidation` and `InvalidArgument` in one function). The rule above implies
it should collapse too, but decision #18's scope is the `validate_write`
boundary; the excise verb is left for a follow-up so this amendment stays
one-line-reversible.

`design/engine.md`, `design/op-store.md`, `design/bindings.md`, and
`acceptance.md` must preserve this split.

## Binding mapping ownership

This file owns the stable inputs bindings map from:

- top-level root (`EngineError` vs `EngineOpenError`)
- module / direct variant identity
- stable machine payload fields

`design/bindings.md` owns the mapping protocol:

- one class per variant
- single rooted hierarchy per binding
- typed attributes rather than message parsing

`interfaces/{python,ts,cli}.md` own idiomatic casing and concrete class names.

## Binding-facing class matrix

The matrix below is the canonical cross-binding class-stem table for 0.6.0.
Per-language interface docs may apply idiomatic casing, but they must not
rename the semantic class stems or collapse distinct rows.

`EngineError::EmbedderRequired` maps to `EmbedderRequiredError` in both SDKs.
Its stable `FDB_EMBEDDER_REQUIRED` payload has `operation`, `state`, ordered
`remediations`, and the documentation URL; Python exposes
`documentation_url`, TypeScript exposes `documentationUrl`. It applies only to
an absent configured runtime. `SchedulerError` remains the bounded-drain result
while outstanding operational work, such as equivalence-refused work, prevents
idleness. A worker that exhausts retries instead records a durable `failed`
terminal, after which `drain` may return `Ok` once idle. Neither is this
configuration error.

| `EngineError::VectorEquivalenceMismatch` | `VectorEquivalenceMismatchError` | `VectorEquivalenceMismatchError` | dense refused (query-time) |

2026-07-28 amendment (0.8.20 Slice 22, R-20-VC decision #18): `InvalidArgument`
added to BOTH tables above. It was absent from the module taxonomy and from this
matrix despite ~15 engine raise sites and a live `InvalidArgumentError` /
`FDB_INVALID_ARGUMENT` class in both SDKs — a documentation defect in the
taxonomy of record, not a new surface. The napi envelope code is
`FDB_INVALID_ARGUMENT`; unlike the message-less `WriteValidation` it carries an
actionable message. See the Validation boundary section for the rule that now
separates the two.

2026-05-16 amendment: `EmbedderNotConfigured` and `KindNotVectorIndexed` leaf
classes added per Phase 11a codex reviewer finding #3. Python and TS bindings
expose them as distinct leaves; both descend from the single rooted base
(`EmbedderNotConfiguredError` ← `EmbedderError` ← `EngineError`;
`KindNotVectorIndexedError` ← `VectorError` ← `EngineError`).

Decision note:

- Python uses a single rooted hierarchy beneath one base class.
- TypeScript uses one catch-all base class, `FathomDbError`, with distinct
  open-time and runtime leaf classes beneath it.
- The leaf-class rows above are canonical regardless of whether TS ultimately
  groups open-time and runtime leaves in documentation.

## Corruption detail owner

This file is the canonical host for the `CorruptionDetail` payload contract
carried by `EngineOpenError::Corruption`:

- `CorruptionKind`
- `OpenStage`
- `CorruptionLocator`
- `RecoveryHint.code`
- `RecoveryHint.doc_anchor`

`design/engine.md` and `design/recovery.md` cite these rows by stable code and
must not redeclare the same join in parallel.

### Surface split

Two machine-readable surfaces exist and are intentionally not the same thing:

- `CorruptionKind` + `OpenStage` are the structured `Engine.open` error surface.
- `code` is the stable report / dispatch surface used by bindings and doctor
  output.

Doctor finding codes are not required to equal the `Engine.open`
`CorruptionKind` set. In particular, `E_CORRUPT_INTEGRITY_CHECK` is a
doctor-report code for `doctor check-integrity --full`, not an `Engine.open`
corruption kind.

### `OpenStage`

The complete 0.6.0 `OpenStage` enum for corruption detail is exactly:

- `WalReplay`
- `HeaderProbe`
- `SchemaProbe`
- `EmbedderIdentity`

Per ADR-0.6.0-corruption-open-behavior, `LockAcquisition` is not an
`OpenStage` member. Lock contention is surfaced via a separate typed
`DatabaseLocked` error, not as corruption detail.

### `Engine.open` corruption table

`Engine.open` in 0.6.0 exposes exactly four corruption-emitting stages and four
open-path corruption kinds.

| `OpenStage`        | `CorruptionKind`        | Typical `CorruptionLocator`                                                                                                               | `RecoveryHint.code`           | `RecoveryHint.doc_anchor`                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `WalReplay`        | `WalReplayFailure`      | `PageId { page: u32 }`, `FileOffset { offset: u64 }`, `OpaqueSqliteError { sqlite_extended_code: i32 }`                                   | `E_CORRUPT_WAL_REPLAY`        | `design/recovery.md#wal-replay-failures`     |
| `HeaderProbe`      | `HeaderMalformed`       | `FileOffset { offset: u64 }`, `OpaqueSqliteError { sqlite_extended_code: i32 }`                                                           | `E_CORRUPT_HEADER`            | `design/recovery.md#header-malformed`        |
| `SchemaProbe`      | `SchemaInconsistent`    | `TableRow { table: &'static str, rowid: i64 }`, `MigrationStep { from: u32, to: u32 }`, `OpaqueSqliteError { sqlite_extended_code: i32 }` | `E_CORRUPT_SCHEMA`            | `design/recovery.md#schema-inconsistent`     |
| `EmbedderIdentity` | `EmbedderIdentityDrift` | `TableRow { table: &'static str, rowid: i64 }`, `OpaqueSqliteError { sqlite_extended_code: i32 }`                                         | `E_CORRUPT_EMBEDDER_IDENTITY` | `design/recovery.md#embedder-identity-drift` |

The table above is the only canonical materialized join for the open-path
corruption contract in 0.6.0.

### `CorruptionLocator` ownership

`CorruptionLocator` keeps the broader locator enum even though `Engine.open`
uses only a subset of variants today. Every variant remains justified:

| `CorruptionLocator`                                     | Why it exists in 0.6.0                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FileOffset { offset: u64 }`                            | Header/page-byte diagnosis needs a byte-position locator that survives even when no logical row can be decoded.                           |
| `PageId { page: u32 }`                                  | WAL replay and page-level diagnosis still produce page ids; this remains justified even after integrity-check removal from the open path. |
| `TableRow { table: &'static str, rowid: i64 }`          | Schema and embedder-profile failures may be row-addressable even when the file is otherwise readable.                                     |
| `Vec0ShadowRow { partition: &'static str, rowid: i64 }` | Doctor / recovery diagnostics may need to point at sqlite-vec shadow rows, which are not user-named tables.                               |
| `MigrationStep { from: u32, to: u32 }`                  | Some failures are best localized to a migration edge rather than a page or row.                                                           |
| `OpaqueSqliteError { sqlite_extended_code: i32 }`       | Required fallback when SQLite surfaces corruption without a usable structured locator; replaces any forbidden `Unspecified` escape hatch. |

### Doctor-only finding codes

Doctor/report codes share the same stable `code` dispatch surface, but they are
not constrained to map 1:1 to open-path enums.

| `code`                      | Surface                                 | Meaning                                                                                            | `doc_anchor`                                       |

## Foreign-cause sanitization

When a module wraps a foreign cause (`rusqlite::Error`, `io::Error`,
`serde_json::Error`), the module doc owns the semantic category while this file
owns the shared sanitization rule:

- `Display` is safe for callers and operators: no raw SQL text, absolute host
  paths, or parser byte offsets as the primary message.
- Full foreign cause chains remain available to engine-internal logging and
  debug builds.
- Bindings do not flatten the sanitized type back into a generic string error.

This keeps module attribution visible without turning foreign dependency message
formats into public contract.
