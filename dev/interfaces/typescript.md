# TypeScript Interface

This file owns TypeScript-visible symbol spelling and export shape. Cross-
binding parity remains owned by `design/bindings.md`.

## Runtime surface

The **core** runtime verbs available to TypeScript callers are:

- `Engine.open(...)`
- `engine.write(...)`
- `engine.search(...)`
- `engine.close()`
- `admin.configure(...)`

The full governed set is pinned by
`src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json`, which `surface.test.ts`
loads: the core five plus `engine.searchTextOnly`, `engine.embed`, `rerank`,
the `read.*` namespace (`get`, `getMany`, `collection`, `mutations`, `list`,
`crossedBoundarySince`, `projections`, `projectionStatus`, `embeddingReadiness`), the `graph.*`
namespace (`neighbors`, `searchExpand`), the BYO-LLM verbs
(`engine.ingestWithExtractor`,
`engine.consolidateWithProvider`), `engine.configureProjections`, and the
lifecycle/erasure verbs below. Verb NAMES are camelCase in TS; the governed
allowlist entries stay dotted snake_case where the two differ
(`read.get_many` ↔ `read.getMany`).

### Lifecycle + erasure verbs (0.8.19 Slice 10 / 0.8.20 Slice 5d)

Governed and HITL-SIGNED; **not** recovery verbs (none carries a REQ-054
denylist name).

- `engine.transition(logicalId: string, toState: LifecycleState, reason?:
  string | null): Promise<void>` — move a GOVERNED node between existence
  states per the engine-enforced legal-transition table (`pending→active`
  promote, `pending→deleted` REJECTED, `active→deleted` soft-delete,
  `deleted→active` undelete). `LifecycleState` is the exported string union
  `"pending" | "active" | "deleted" | "purged"`. Keys on the bare `logicalId`
  — the `l:` id space ONLY; any other throws
  `NotLifecycleAddressableError`. An illegal move throws
  `IllegalTransitionError` with `fromState` / `toState` / `legal` (never
  `from`, which is a reserved word in the Python peer — parity-safe naming, S7).
- `engine.purge(logicalId: string): Promise<void>` — irreversible hard-erase of
  a governed node across every row-owned target. DELETED-FIRST and IDEMPOTENT.
  **No restore counterpart exists on any surface.**
- `engine.eraseSource(sourceId: string): Promise<EraseReport>` — erase every
  canonical row carrying `sourceId` plus its row-owned projections, then finish
  at rest (telemetry redaction + WAL truncation). The COMPANION to `purge`:
  `eraseSource` reaches ANONYMOUS rows (no `logicalId`) that `purge` cannot.
  Idempotent. Rejects with `WriteValidationError` for an empty /
  whitespace-only / reserved (`_`-prefixed) id, and with
  `ErasureIncompleteError` (with `stage` / `detail`) rather than resolving when
  the at-rest step did not complete. `EraseReport` is
  `{ sourceRef, nodesExcised, edgesExcised, projectionsInvalidated }`.

All runtime operations are Promise-returning on the TS surface.

### Module-level CLS batch embedding (0.8.20 Slice 40)

- `embedBatchCls(texts: readonly string[]): Promise<number[][]>` — batch-embed
  `texts` with the pinned BGE-small default embedder using **CLS pooling** and
  L2 normalization. The output has one vector per input in input order; `[]`
  returns `[]` without loading weights. This is deliberately distinct from
  `engine.embed(text)`, whose engine read path uses Mean pooling. It is the
  camelCase peer of Python's `embed_batch_cls`; both reject invalid FFI strings
  and surface `EmbedderNotConfiguredError` when built without the default
  embedder.

`Engine.open(...)` returns a Promise resolving to the engine handle. The
structured open report owned by `design/engine.md` is accessible after open
via `engine.openReport()` (see Engine-attached instrumentation / control
below).

`Engine.open(path, options?)` accepts an options object with an `engineConfig`
member carrying the engine-owned knobs from `design/engine.md` in camelCase:

- `embedderPoolSize`
- `schedulerRuntimeThreads`
- `provenanceRowCap`
- `embedderCallTimeoutMs`
- `slowThresholdMs`

If TypeScript exposes ThreadsafeFunction handoff-pool sizing, that option is a
TS binding-runtime option beside `engineConfig`, not a canonical engine config
field and not a Python parity obligation.

## Engine-attached instrumentation / control

These are public instance methods, not extra top-level SDK verbs:

- `engine.drain(timeoutMs)`
- `engine.counters()`
- `engine.openReport()`
- `engine.setProfiling(enabled)`
- `engine.setSlowThresholdMs(value)`

Subscriber attachment is provided by:

- `engine.attachSubscriber(callback, { heartbeatIntervalMs? })`

`callback` receives the stable `fathomdb` payload described in
`design/bindings.md`.

## Caller-visible data shapes

- `WriteReceipt.cursor`, `WriteReceipt.rowCursors`,
  `WriteReceipt.danglingEdgeEndpoints`
- `SearchResult.projectionCursor`
- `SearchResult.softFallback.branch`

`softFallback.branch` uses the typed values owned by `design/retrieval.md`.

### `OpenReport.embedderGpuAllocationWitness` (0.8.23 Slice 80.6)

`engine.openReport().embedderGpuAllocationWitness` is a readonly
`GpuAllocationWitness | null`: the retained
`fathomdb.tegra-gpu-allocation-witness/v1` record measured **in this process**
during the open (`design/0.8.23-aarch64-tegra.md` D-80.6-6, AC80-6, R80-13).

`null` means **no witness was taken**, never "a witness measured nothing". A
zero, negative, or below-floor allocation delta is a typed failure inside the
witness and fails the open, so a zero-valued record is unreachable here.

It is populated only when `FATHOMDB_GPU_ALLOCATION_WITNESS=1` (or `true`) is
set, the artifact has CUDA compiled in, and the device policy actually selected
CUDA for the default embedder. It is opt-in because producing it costs a second
model load plus a multi-gigabyte deliberate control allocation. A requested
witness that cannot be produced rejects the open naming the witness's own
failure tag; it never degrades to `null`.

The readonly fields are `schema`, `soleGpuConsumerPrecondition`,
`deviceOrdinalRequested`, `deviceOrdinalActual`, `deviceUuid`, `deviceName`,
`computeCapability`, `freeBeforeBytes`, `freeAfterBytes`, `totalBytes`,
`deltaBytes`, `deltaFloorBytes`, `controlAllocationRequestBytes`,
`controlBlockCount`, `controlFreeBeforeBytes`, `controlFreeAfterBytes`,
`controlDeltaBytes`, and `embeddedVectorDim` — every number the verdict used,
so a reader re-derives the verdict rather than trusting it (R80-13). Byte
counts are JavaScript numbers, exact for every physically reachable
device-memory value.

### `OpenReport.embedderDeviceResolution` (0.8.23 Slice 70)

`engine.openReport().embedderDeviceResolution` is a readonly
`DeviceResolution | null`. When present, it preserves `requestedPolicy`
(`"auto"`, `"cpu"`, or `"cuda:N"`), `cudaCompiled`, the effective
`EffectiveEmbedDevice` (`kind === "cpu" | "cuda"` and safe CUDA facts for a
CUDA selection), the ordered process-visible CUDA device inventory
(`visibleOrdinal`, UUID, name, compute capability), optional selected UUID,
and the optional automatic-fallback `reason`. Ordinals are
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`-relative, never inferred host ordinals. It is present
for default-embedder opens and the internal
`EmbedderChoice::CallerWithDeviceResolution` path; an ONNX caller uses that
path when it needs its final session outcome reported. It is `null` when no
resolution was supplied. Forced CUDA is an open rejection, never a CPU report.

The readonly additive fields are `visibleCudaDevices: readonly CudaVisibleDevice[]`
(each `visibleOrdinal`, `uuid`, `name`, `computeCapability`) and
`selectedCudaUuid: string | null`; a present selected UUID names exactly one
inventory member. CPU-effective automatic outcomes retain the observed
inventory.

This `DeviceResolution` is normal open-time evidence only. The CLI-only
`DoctorGpuDiagnosticResult` is intentionally distinct: a
`CudaProbeError::ProbeFailed` may be recorded as automatic CPU open evidence,
whereas `doctor gpu` maps it to `probe_failed` and exit `70`. TypeScript exposes
neither a doctor method nor a device-setting API.

This is open-time evidence only: it adds no TypeScript device-setting API.
`FATHOMDB_EMBED_DEVICE` remains the single cross-surface policy transport.

### `SearchHit.id` is `IdSpace` (C-2, 0.8.19 / TC-8)

`SearchHit.id` is the exported **`IdSpace`** interface, not the pre-0.8.19
`number` `write_cursor`. This is the largest consumer-visible break in the
0.8.9 → 0.8.20 span and is part of the HITL-SIGNED 0.8.19 Slice-10 delta.

- `IdSpace` is `{ space: string; value: string }`, where `space` is
  `"logical"` | `"content"` | `"passage"` and `value` is the BARE,
  prefix-stripped id. `` `${prefix}${value}` `` (`l:` / `h:` / `p:`)
  reproduces the pre-swap `stableId` byte-for-byte.
- It is the **PERMANENT** caller-facing identity, not an interim carrier; the
  older "interim `write_cursor`" framing is superseded.
- The engine's positional `write_cursor` is **not surfaced** as a hit id.
  `NodeRecord.writeCursor` still exists but is engine-internal book-keeping,
  reassigned on re-projection, and is NOT the same carrier.
- Only `space === "logical"` is lifecycle-addressable by `transition` /
  `purge`.

`SearchHit.sourceId` (`string | null`) carries the hit's source-document
provenance — the identifier `engine.eraseSource` consumes — and since TC-31
(0.8.20) it is populated on EVERY hit path. `SearchHit.ceScore`
(`number | null`) is the CE score for in-pool reranked hits.

### `sourceId` is MANDATORY on canonical write items (0.8.20 Slice 5c, R-20-E3)

Every **node** and **edge** item passed to `engine.write` must carry a
`sourceId` (or the snake_case `source_id` fallback, camelCase consulted
first). `eraseSource` addresses rows BY that id, so a row written without one
is reachable by no erasure call.

Rust makes the absence inexpressible through the `SourceId` newtype; TypeScript
has no such guarantee at the N-API boundary, so `json_source_id_required`
throws a typed **`WriteValidationError`** (`FDB_WRITE_VALIDATION`) for a
missing, empty, whitespace-only or **reserved** (`_`-prefixed) id — mirroring
the Python binding exactly.

```typescript
await engine.write([
  { kind: "note", body: "…", sourceId: "doc-42" },
  { kind: "mentions", from: "a", to: "b", sourceId: "doc-42" },
]);
```

The engine's reserved namespace (`_engine:*` and the `_legacy:pre-0.8.20`
migration cohort) is refused here and is reachable only through
`fathomdb recover --excise-source`.

**Policy: `sourceId` MUST NOT contain personal data.** It is echoed on every
`SearchHit` and recorded in the retention-EXEMPT erasure-audit row, so it
outlives the rows it names. Use an opaque document or tenant id.

## Versioned identity and provenance (0.8.25 Slice 15)

A write item may add a closed `provenance` object. TypeScript accepts only the
camel-case `schemaVersion`, `artifactRevisionId`, `sourceVersionId`,
`sourceRevisionId`, `sourceLocator`, `canonicalSourceHash`, `startInclusive`,
`endExclusive`, and `digestHex` spellings. Offset values are canonical unsigned
decimal strings. Exported types are `CanonicalHash`, `WholeBodySourceLocator`,
`Utf8BytesSourceLocator`, `SourceLocator`, `CanonicalWriteProvenanceV1`,
`DerivedWriteProvenanceV1`, and `WriteProvenanceV1`.

Unknown fields, casing aliases, unsupported versions, invalid IDs, hashes, or
UTF-8 byte spans throw `ProvenanceError` with code `FDB_PROVENANCE` and expose
closed `reason` and JSON-pointer `fieldPath` fields. Legacy objects remain
accepted and the `WriteReceipt` shape is unchanged.

## Source dependencies (0.8.25 Slice 20)

`registerSourceDependency`, `dependenciesForSource`, and
`dependencyForDerived` accept closed camel-case request objects. Exported
request interfaces are `SourceDependencyRegistrationV1`,
`DependencySourceLookupV1`, and `DependencyDerivedLookupV1`; results are
`SourceDependencyV1` and `DependencyListV1`.

`registeredDependencyGeneration` is a canonical unsigned decimal string and is
independent of write cursors and projection terminals. Invalid request shape,
identity, conflicts, bounds, or generation exhaustion throw `DependencyError`
with code `FDB_DEPENDENCY`, a closed `reason`, and RFC 6901 `fieldPath`.
Requests validate schema version, unknown fields, required field/type, then
identity grammar before database-dependent checks.

## Atomic actuation (0.8.25 Slice 25)

`engine.actuate(request)` accepts a closed camel-case `ActuationBatchV1` with
1–128 ordered operations: `put_canonical_node`, `put_derived_node`,
`register_source_dependency`, or `transition_lifecycle`. It returns
`ActuationReceiptV1`. Write boundaries, dependency generations, and projection
cursors use canonical unsigned decimal strings.

Malformed requests and operation-ID conflict/erasure throw `ActuationError`
with code `FDB_ACTUATION`, closed `reason`, and canonical RFC 6901 `fieldPath`.
Database-dependent domain refusals are terminal receipts, not exceptions.
Exact replay is idempotent; source erasure and purge make a matching operation
ID permanently unusable without retaining its prior receipt content.

`sourceId` follows the Engine `SourceId` grammar rather than the generic
content-string FFI guard, so an embedded NUL is preserved exactly; body, kind,
and other content/control strings retain the REQ-064 rejection.

## Node write-item validity window (0.8.20 Slice 15b, TC-34)

`engine.write([...])` takes loose objects, not typed structs. A **node** item
accepts two optional validity keys:

- `validFrom` / `valid_from` — `number | null`, INCLUSIVE lower bound, INTEGER
  epoch **seconds** UTC. Omitted or `null` lands SQL NULL = unbounded below.
- `validUntil` / `valid_until` — `number | null`, EXCLUSIVE upper bound, same
  units. Omitted or `null` lands SQL NULL = unbounded above.

**BOTH spellings are accepted** for each bound. The camelCase spelling is
consulted first and the snake_case spelling is the fallback, mirroring the
existing edge `tValid` / `t_valid` precedent (which TC-33 aligns to the same
INTEGER epoch-seconds units — see below), so a caller porting from the Python
surface keeps working.

```typescript
await engine.write([
  {
    kind: "note",
    body: "…",
    sourceId: "s1",
    validFrom: 1_700_000_000,
    validUntil: 1_700_003_600,
  },
]);
```

The window is **half-open** `[validFrom, validUntil)`: an instant equal to
`validFrom` is IN, an instant equal to `validUntil` is OUT.

**Omitting both keys preserves existing default-view visibility.** The pair
binds NULL/NULL — exactly what every pre-slice row already carries — so an
unchanged caller sees unchanged behaviour.

Refusals (the rule is enforced in the engine's `validate_write`, so it is
identical across Rust / Python / TypeScript and cannot drift):

- Both bounds present with `validFrom >= validUntil` is an UNSATISFIABLE window
  and rejects with **`WriteValidationError`**. Validation runs before any insert,
  so the **whole batch** is rejected.

  > **BREAKING (0.8.20 Slice 22, decision #18).** This rejected with
  > `InvalidArgumentError` (napi code `FDB_INVALID_ARGUMENT`) **carrying both
  > bounds in `message`**, while a non-integral bound from the same call rejected
  > with `WriteValidationError`. Both are now `WriteValidationError` — one family
  > for the whole write-validation boundary (`dev/design/errors.md`, 2026-07-28
  > amendment). The envelope is now `FDB_WRITE_VALIDATION` with the fixed message
  > `"write validation error"` and `data: null`; **the bounds are gone**. A caller
  > that read them out of `message` must validate the pair before calling.
  > `InvalidArgumentError` is unchanged for every other use.
- A **one-sided** window is never refused, however extreme its single bound.
- A non-integral bound rejects with `WriteValidationError`; the value is never
  truncated or coerced.

These are keys on an existing verb, not a new verb: the runtime-verb surface
above is unchanged. The fields-only delta is **HITL-SIGNED 2026-07-29 (steward
`seq-157`)**.

## Edge temporal fields (0.8.20 Slice 15c, TC-33)

An **edge** item accepts two optional temporal keys. As of TC-33
(HITL-RATIFIED 2026-07-21) these are **INTEGER epoch seconds (UTC)** — the same
representation as the node validity window and as storage — NOT ISO-8601
strings, which they used to be:

- `tValid` / `t_valid` — `number | null`, event valid-time. `null` = unknown /
  still valid.
- `tInvalid` / `t_invalid` — `number | null`, event invalid-time. `null` =
  **still valid**.

**BOTH spellings are accepted** for each field (camelCase first, snake_case
fallback), exactly as for the node window.

```typescript
await engine.write([
  {
    kind: "works_for",
    from: "bob",
    to: "acme",
    sourceId: "s1",
    tValid: 1_546_300_800, // 2019-01-01T00:00:00Z
    tInvalid: null,        // still valid
  },
]);
```

`null`/omitted is the ONLY way to say "unknown"; it lands SQL NULL, which reads
as **still valid**. A non-integral field rejects with `WriteValidationError` and
is never coerced — the same `json_i64_alt` validator serves the node window and
the edge fields, so the old string-accepting `json_str_alt` no longer applies.

> ⚠ **Sign-off status of the TC-33 edge-temporal delta is UNRESOLVED — do not
> assert either way.** The allowlist `_comment` mentions `t_valid`/`t_invalid`
> only as the **Slice-30 `PreparedWrite::Edge` PRECEDENT** cited inside the
> Slice-15b (node-validity) paragraph. There is **no TC-33 sign-off recorded**
> anywhere in that file, so a mechanical grep that reports these literals as
> "signed" is reading the precedent, not a signature. Flagged for a
> Steward/HITL ruling by 0.8.20 Slice 39 (`R-20-DOC`); the marker below is left
> exactly as the implementing slice wrote it.

**Layering note.** This is the GOVERNED SDK write surface. ISO-8601 survives
ONLY on the **BYO-LLM extractor wire** (`fathomdb.extract.v1`), where the engine
normalises each timestamp to epoch seconds with a HARD REJECTION of any value it
cannot parse — an unparseable timestamp must never coerce to NULL, because a
NULL `t_invalid` reads as "still valid" and would resurrect an invalidated edge.
Fields-only delta, **PROPOSED, NOT SIGNED**.

## Projection registry (0.8.20 Slice 15d, R-20-PR / C-1)

The registry pair declares and inspects projections over interpretive
attributes. Its verbs, the `ProjectionSpec` / `ProjectionRole` /
`ProjectionDelta` types and the typed `ProjectionDestructiveError` are
**HITL-SIGNED 2026-07-29 (steward `seq-157`)**. ⚠ The Slice-20 (R-20-DR)
readiness additions — the exported `DenseReadiness` union and
`ProjectionSpec.vectorDenseReadiness` — are **NOT** part of that `seq-157`
signature. Their closed `DenseReadiness` vocabulary is separately
**HITL-SIGNED 2026-08-07 (steward `seq-246`)** by Slice 21 F5/C1, with a
  governed-surface signature. Caller input is accept-inert; Slice 21 runtime
  selection emits `"unavailable"` when no usable dense runtime exists.

- `engine.configureProjections(specs, drop?)` → `Promise<ProjectionDelta>`.
  Declarative, idempotent apply: the engine diffs `specs` against the durable
  registry and backfills the difference in one transaction. `drop` is EXPLICIT —
  omitting a live projection from `specs` does NOT drop it; removal requires
  naming it in `drop`. A destructive change (a role removal or a
  tokenizer/embedder change) without a drop throws `ProjectionDestructiveError`
  (`name`/`delta` fields, mapped from the `FDB_PROJECTION_DESTRUCTIVE` envelope).
  Re-applying an unchanged spec resolves to `{ unchanged: true }`.
- `read.projections(engine)` → `Promise<ProjectionSpec[]>`, sorted by name — the
  registry introspection (folded into `read.*`).
- `read.projectionStatus(engine)` → `Promise<ProjectionRuntimeStatus>` —
  **HITL-SIGNED 2026-08-07 (steward `seq-247`)** C5 status read. It is a pure
  facade over durable declarations and this open engine session's dense runtime;
  it does not configure projections or schedule, wake, or drain work. It is not
  a decorated `ProjectionSpec` or the internal lifecycle `ProjectionStatus`.

`ProjectionRuntimeStatus` is
`{ runtimeEmbedderAvailable, runtimeUnavailabilityReason, projections,
vectorUnsupportedKinds }`. `ProjectionRuntimeUnavailabilityReason` is exactly
`"none" | "no_runtime" | "vector_equivalence_disabled"`; `"none"` occurs
exactly when the runtime is available. Each sorted
`ProjectionRuntimeStatusEntry` is `{ name, denseReadiness }`, with
`ProjectionStatusDenseReadiness` exactly `"not_declared" | "unavailable" |
"embedding" | "ready"`. `not_declared` means no effective vector arm
(`searchable` plus a vector sub-object); a legacy non-searchable vector
sub-object therefore remains `not_declared`. The other values are corpus-wide
shared-pipeline facts, not per-projection progress. `vectorUnsupportedKinds` is
sorted/deduplicated and is `[]` unless an effective vector arm exists.

`ProjectionSpec` is
`{ name, roles: ProjectionRole[], fts, ftsTokenizer?, vector, vectorEmbedder?,
vectorDenseReadiness? }`.
`ProjectionRole` is the string union `"filterable" | "rankable" | "searchable"`;
`searchable→FTS` and `searchable→vector` are tier labels carried by the
`fts`/`vector` sub-object flags, not roles. Cheap roles (`filterable`,
`searchable→FTS`) build same-transaction; `rankable` and the `searchable→vector`
sub-target are persisted-but-deferred (reported in `ProjectionDelta.deferred`).
`ProjectionDelta` is
`{ built, dropped, deferred, unchanged, vectorUnsupportedKinds }`. Field names
are camelCase per this file's casing rule.

### Embedding readiness (0.8.23 Slice 30)

`read.embeddingReadiness(engine): Promise<EmbeddingReadiness>` is an additive,
HITL-authorized governed read. It is a pure current view: it neither configures
an embedder nor wakes, schedules, or drains work. `EmbeddingReadiness` is
`{ state: "ready" | "processing" | "deferred" | "blocked",
usableEmbedder: boolean, pendingCount: number, affectedKinds: string[],
code: "FDB_EMBEDDER_REQUIRED" | null,
operation: "graph_edge_body_projection" | "vector_projection" | null,
remediations: string[], documentationUrl: string | null }`. `affectedKinds` is
sorted and no pending body text is exposed.

For `state === "blocked"`, `code` is `"FDB_EMBEDDER_REQUIRED"`, `operation` is
non-null, and the other payload fields are populated. For every other state,
the three nullable fields are `null` and `remediations` is empty. `"blocked"`
occurs only when pending work exists and the engine was opened without a
configured runtime. In that condition `engine.drain(...)` rejects immediately
with `EmbedderRequiredError` carrying the same camelCase fields; callers must
not parse the message. An attached runtime refused by identity/equivalence
checks leaves outstanding work as operational `"deferred"` behavior and is
never recast as this configuration error. A worker that exhausts its retries
instead records a durable `failed` terminal; once the scheduler is idle,
`engine.drain(...)` may resolve normally. Neither operational path is
`EmbedderRequiredError`.

### `fts` / `vector` require the `searchable` role (0.8.20 Slice 23, R-20-SV)

⚠ **BREAKING.** `engine.configureProjections` REJECTS a `ProjectionSpec` with
`fts: true` or `vector: true` whose `roles` does not include `"searchable"`. The
promise rejects with **`WriteValidationError`**, mapped from the
`FDB_WRITE_VALIDATION` envelope (message `"write validation error"`,
`data: null` — the variant is message-less).

- **Why.** `searchable→FTS` / `searchable→vector` are tier labels: the sub-object
  flags SELECT a sub-target of `searchable` and do not CONFER it, so without the
  role the declaration builds, embeds and enrols nothing. HITL ruling
  2026-07-24 (`dev/plans/plan-0.8.20.md` §11 item 4, option (b) REJECT). The
  family is `WriteValidationError` per decision #18 — a malformed submitted SHAPE
  is one family (`dev/design/errors.md`).
- **This SUPERSEDES the Slice 15d fix-4 accept-and-round-trip position** for this
  shape, and with it the "accept-inert" precedent cited under
  `vectorDenseReadiness` below.
- **Keyed on the ABSENCE of `"searchable"` alone** — `"filterable"` /
  `"rankable"` are orthogonal and neither substitutes for it.
- **A rejected request is a TOTAL no-op**: validation runs before any write, so
  one invalid spec anywhere in `specs` aborts the whole call — valid siblings are
  not registered and `drop` entries do not apply.
- **`read.projections(engine)` is UNAFFECTED** — a pure read that rejects nothing.
- **LEGACY databases.** Rows declared in this shape while the engine accepted it
  still read back verbatim, but `read.projections` output can no longer be fed
  straight back into `configureProjections` for them: re-applying rejects, and
  re-declaring only the valid half rejects with `ProjectionDestructiveError` (it
  removes the stored sub-object). Remedies: add `"searchable"` to `roles`, or name
  the projection in `drop`.
- **Known diagnostic cost (TC-95/TC-98, HITL-deferred).** The envelope carries
  `data: null`, so with an ARRAY of specs it cannot name WHICH one was invalid.

### `vectorUnsupportedKinds` (0.8.20 Slice 22, R-20-VC / TC-67)

`ProjectionDelta.vectorUnsupportedKinds` is a `string[]` of node **kinds** — not
attribute names. The first three arrays carry projection attribute names; this one
carries the vector-eligible node kinds present in the corpus that the vector
writer can **never** commit, so no `searchable→vector` declaration will ever
produce an embedding for them.

**What it means for your data.** Rows of a reported kind still get **FTS and
lexical search**; they will simply never participate in dense/vector retrieval —
in this session or any future one. Your options are to use one of the kinds the
engine's locked vocabulary maps, or to accept lexical-only retrieval for those
rows. Waiting is not one of them, which is exactly what the field exists to say:
before it, "no embedder attached this session" (transient) and "this kind will
never be embedded" (permanent) both arrived as the same `deferred` entry.

- **Sorted, de-duplicated, and empty (`[]`) rather than absent** — read it
  unconditionally.
- **A STATE report, not a diff.** It does not feed `unchanged`, so an idempotent
  re-apply resolves to `{ unchanged: true }` with `built`/`dropped`/`deferred`
  empty **and this array populated**.
- **Embedder-independent.** Identical whether or not the engine was opened with
  an embedder — the vocabulary is static, so the fact does not depend on the
  session. Do not read it as the deferral.
- **Output-only.** `configureProjections` accepts specs, never a delta, so this
  field has no inbound direction and cannot affect the `read.projections` →
  `configureProjections` round-trip.
- **Residual — computed at DECLARE time.** A non-committable kind written *after*
  the call is not in a delta you already hold. To refresh, re-apply the same spec:
  an idempotent no-op that returns a current report.
- **Not an error, not a readiness change.** Nothing is rejected and, with a
  usable dense runtime, `vectorDenseReadiness` still reaches `"ready"` — an
  un-enrolled kind is not outstanding work. Without a usable runtime, runtime
  selection remains `"unavailable"`.

### `vectorDenseReadiness` (0.8.20 Slice 20, R-20-DR)

`ProjectionSpec.vectorDenseReadiness` is **engine-set READ METADATA**, hung off
the `vector` sub-object, typed by the net-new exported string union

```ts
export type DenseReadiness = "unavailable" | "embedding" | "ready";
```

It is `null`/omitted on every caller-authored spec and is populated only on the
way OUT of `read.projections(engine)` — and only for a spec that declares
`vector: true`. `filterable` and `searchable→FTS` are same-transaction (non-stale
on commit) so they have no readiness axis at all; `searchable→vector` is async
and rebuild-durable, so it carries one.

- **Exactly three spellings: `"unavailable"`, `"embedding"`, and `"ready"`.**
  Their signed target meanings are no usable dense runtime (absent or
  equivalence-refused), usable runtime with eligible outstanding work, and
  usable quiescent work, respectively. `"pending"` is
  DELIBERATELY not one of them — that token is RESERVED for the orthogonal
  **admission** axis (quarantine/trust, an app judgment). Do not reuse the word.
- **Runtime selection.** `read.projections` first applies one usable-dense-
  runtime predicate: no runtime or an equivalence refusal yields
  `"unavailable"`. With a usable runtime it derives `"embedding"` /
  `"ready"` from the shared outstanding-work predicate. This adds no schema
  step or stored readiness field.
- **Accept-inert on the way in.** Passing `vectorDenseReadiness` to
  `engine.configureProjections` neither stores nor changes anything: it is not
  part of the declaration and the engine always reports the derived truth. That
  is deliberate, so `read.projections` output stays feedable straight back into
  `configureProjections` as a no-op (`{ unchanged: true }`); an explicit `null`
  is normalized to `undefined` on the way in, exactly as for `ftsTokenizer` /
  `vectorEmbedder`.
  **⚠ 0.8.20 Slice 23 correction:** this accept-inert rule used to be justified by
  analogy with the `fts`/`vector`-without-`searchable` shape. That analogy is
  **OVERRULED** — that shape is now rejected (see above). `vectorDenseReadiness`
  accept-inert is unchanged and stands on its own: it is engine-set READ METADATA,
  never part of a declaration.
- **Two shapes are still hard-rejected**, because they could never round-trip: a
  readiness supplied with `vector: false`, and any spelling outside
  `{"unavailable", "embedding", "ready"}` (including `"pending"`, `""`, and
  `"Ready"`). Both throw the EXISTING `InvalidArgumentError`, mapped from the
  `FDB_INVALID_ARGUMENT` envelope — **no new error type is minted**.
  `null`/omitted is always accepted.
- **Additive.** A caller who never reads the field sees identical behaviour, and
  the slice adds ZERO net-new governed commands; `DenseReadiness` is the only
  net-new export.

### `engine.drain()` is the flush-to-readiness barrier (0.8.20 Slice 20c, R-20-DR)

There is **no `flushEmbeddings()` verb**. The shipped `engine.drain(timeoutMs)` —
note **MILLISECONDS** here, seconds in Python — carries those semantics, so the
surface gains ZERO net-new governed commands. The pinned invariant, tested in
Rust, Python and TypeScript:

> With a usable dense runtime, `await engine.drain(timeoutMs)` resolving ⟹
> `vectorDenseReadiness === "ready"`, **and every vector-eligible row has its
> vector row at rest.**

- **`drain` is a BARRIER, not a trigger.** It waits for the engine's projection
  runtime to go quiescent; it never schedules or wakes anything.
  Deferred/backfill work is enqueued on the **enqueue side** instead:
  `configureProjections` enrols the vector kinds and re-opens the stranded rows
  before it resolves, so the very next `drain` flushes them. Turning the dense arm
  on over an existing corpus is therefore just:

  ```ts
  await configureProjections(engine, [
    { name: "summary", roles: ["searchable"], vector: true },
  ]);
  await engine.drain(60_000); // flush the backfill
  // (await readProjections(engine))[0].vectorDenseReadiness === "ready"
  ```

- **Ordering does not matter.** Write-then-declare and declare-then-write behave
  identically. The write path performs the **same** backfill the declaration
  does, so rows of that kind written by an earlier session — for instance one
  opened with `useDefaultEmbedder: false`, where the declaration persisted but
  deferred — are picked up too, rather than being left behind a `"ready"` that is
  not true of them.
- **The dense arm covers only the engine's locked `kind` vocabulary.** A
  `searchable→vector` declaration turns the dense arm on for node kinds in
  `{email, article, paper, meeting, note, todo, doc}`. Rows of ANY other `kind`
  are accepted and stay lexically searchable, but get **no vector** and are not
  counted as outstanding work, so readiness reaches `"ready"` only with a usable
  dense runtime. An absent or equivalence-refused runtime instead selects
  `"unavailable"`. This is **not** an error condition: `engine.write` does not
  reject them, nothing rejects, and there is no verb to ask about it.
- **Idempotent.** Re-applying an already-satisfied declaration re-embeds nothing
  and resolves `{ unchanged: true }`.
- **Dropping the last `searchable→vector` declaration turns the dense arm back
  off.** `engine.configureProjections([], ["summary"])` un-enrols the node kinds
  that declaration enrolled, so later writes enqueue no embed and `drain` no
  longer waits on them. It **deletes no embedding** — vectors already at rest
  survive the drop, exactly as they always have. Re-declaring re-enrols and
  backfills, so a row written while the arm was off is picked up, not stranded.
  Edge-body vectors are unaffected.
- **The dense arm requires the `searchable` ROLE, not merely `vector: true`**
  (0.8.20 Slice 21c, `TC-71`). A spec such as
  `{ name: "summary", roles: ["filterable"], vector: true }` is **REJECTED since
  0.8.20 Slice 23** (`R-20-SV`, above); until then it was accepted and
  round-tripped verbatim while being **INERT**: it enrolled no kind, backfilled
  nothing, and made no later write enqueue an embedding. That inertness still
  governs the LEGACY population holding the shape at rest. Previously the engine
  keyed the
  dense arm off the stored `vector` sub-object alone, so declaring that
  combination against a session with an embedder silently embedded the whole
  corpus. The inverse moves with it: demoting the last `searchable→vector`
  projection to `filterable + vector`, or dropping it while an inert
  `filterable + vector` sibling survives, now un-enrols exactly as a literal drop
  does. The name is still reported in `deferred`.
- **Graceful-absent without a usable dense runtime:** the declaration persists
  and defers. A later safe open atomically grafts eligible durable work after
  identity and equivalence acceptance; idempotent re-apply remains a repair door.
- **…but graceful-absent stops at the enrolment boundary** (fix-4). Once a kind
  IS enrolled — i.e. some earlier session DID have an embedder — writing that
  kind from a session opened with `useDefaultEmbedder: false` leaves real dense
  work outstanding, and this session cannot satisfy it. The write is **accepted**
  and stays lexically searchable, but `vectorDenseReadiness` reads
  `"unavailable"` and `drain` rejects with typed `EmbedderRequiredError`
  (`FDB_EMBEDDER_REQUIRED`) immediately when configuration is absent. An
  attached-but-equivalence-refused runtime remains an operational unavailable
  condition and is not relabelled as configuration feedback for the rest of that
  session, however long you wait. It is **not** lost: no failure is recorded and
  no terminal is written, so the next session opened WITH an approved runtime
  embeds it through the ordinary scheduler — no re-apply, no operator `rebuild`.
  The configuration outcome is immediate; it is not a timeout and does not
  indicate data loss.
- **`drain` stays bounded** for operational embedding work. Size `timeoutMs`
  for an approved-runtime backfill; an absent runtime instead rejects
  immediately with `EmbedderRequiredError`.

## Errors

### Cross-encoder runtime policy (0.8.23 Slice 71)

The optional cross-encoder reads FATHOMDB_RERANK_DEVICE independently of
FATHOMDB_EMBED_DEVICE. It accepts only auto, cpu, and cuda:N. Forced CUDA must
fail rather than execute cross-encoder inference on CPU. Reranker evidence is
separate from OpenReport.embedderDeviceResolution; it does not claim GPU
candidate retrieval or SQLite work.

The embedder and reranker may select the same process-visible CUDA UUID in one
TypeScript process. That creates independent model instances, not a GPU
reservation, memory quota, scheduler, or evidence that retrieval/FTS/fusion/
graph work used the GPU.

TypeScript exposes one concrete class per canonical row in
`design/errors.md` — **30** of them as of 0.8.25, 1:1 with the Python set
below `EngineError`.

Class examples:

- `DatabaseLockedError`
- `CorruptionError`
- `MigrationError`
- `IncompatibleSchemaVersionError`
- `EmbedderIdentityMismatchError`
- `EmbedderDimensionMismatchError`
- `SchemaValidationError`
- `OverloadedError`
- `ClosingError`
- `ProvenanceError` (`reason`, `fieldPath`, code `FDB_PROVENANCE`)
- `DependencyError` (`reason`, `fieldPath`, code `FDB_DEPENDENCY`)

The 0.8.19/0.8.20 additions, all of which the governed verbs above can throw:

- `IllegalTransitionError` (`fromState`, `toState`, `legal`)
- `NotLifecycleAddressableError` (`idSpace`)
- `ErasureIncompleteError` (`stage`, `detail`) — note the `Error` suffix; the
  class is NOT spelled `ErasureIncomplete`
- `ProjectionDestructiveError` (`name`, `delta`)
- `VectorEquivalenceMismatchError` (`reason`)
- `ConsolidatorError`

TypeScript exports one catch-all base class, `FathomDbError`, and every
concrete class in the `design/errors.md` matrix extends it. Open-time and
runtime classes remain distinct, but callers can catch `FathomDbError` for
both. `FathomDbPanicError` extends `Error`, **not** `FathomDbError`, and is
deliberately outside the catch-all root — it is TS-only (the Python peer is
PyO3's `PanicException`) and is therefore not one of the 27.

⚠ `WriteValidationError` is **message-less** since decision #18: the envelope
is `FDB_WRITE_VALIDATION` with the fixed message `"write validation error"` and
`data: null`, so the offending value is not recoverable from the error.

## Default embedder

`Engine.open(path, { useDefaultEmbedder: true })` opts into the engine's
default embedder (`fathomdb-bge-small-en-v1.5`). On first use, weights
are downloaded from HuggingFace and cached under
`~/.cache/fathomdb/embedders/`; subsequent opens hit the warm cache. See
`dev/adr/ADR-0.7.1-default-embedder-weight-fetch.md` for the network-
surface scope (opt-in only; sha256-verified; visible via
`OpenReport.embedderEvents`). The default (`useDefaultEmbedder: false`
or omitted) opens without an embedder; subsequent vector writes reject
with `EmbedderNotConfiguredError`.

### `denseDisabled` and the cached equivalence verdict (0.8.20 Slice 22, TC-68)

`OpenReport.denseDisabled` / `engine.denseDisabled()` still mean "the dense arm is
refusing", and the typed query-time `VectorEquivalenceMismatchError` and the
`searchTextOnly` fallback are unchanged. **What changed is when the check behind
them runs.** The 0.8.18 vector-equivalence self-check used to re-embed its 45
probes on *every* open; since 0.8.20 the engine caches that verdict against a
fingerprint of the embedder identity, the pinned mean vector, the probe fixture,
the divergence floors and the stored reference baseline. An open whose fingerprint
is unchanged does **zero** probe embeds — the dominant cost of opening a
vector-indexed workspace with a live embedder — and reuses the previous verdict.

Read `denseDisabled` accordingly: it reports the arm's status **as verified at the
last open whose fingerprint differed**, not a fresh re-verification at this open. A
backend that drifts without changing its declared identity (the same model moved
between CPU and GPU, or rebuilt against a new library) is therefore no longer
caught per-open. An identity *change* is unaffected: it still rejects the open with
`EmbedderIdentityMismatchError`, ahead of any cache. An unreadable or absent cached
verdict runs the probe rather than trusting it. Full rationale and the residual:
`dev/design/0.8.20-tc68-equivalence-probe-fingerprint-cache.md`.

**Scope.** The self-check guards **accidental** backend drift and a corrupt
baseline. It is **not** tamper evidence: an actor with write access to the database
file can rewrite the stored probe baseline — which defeats the check even when it
runs in full, exactly as it did before the cache — or the cached marker, or the
vectors themselves. Nothing at rest is authenticated. Do not read `denseDisabled`
as a tamper signal. **The cache does make one of those routes cheaper** (a forged
marker needs only a publicly computable digest; re-authoring the baseline needs the
other backend's 45 exact embeddings), bounded by the residual above: a
same-identity drift is already served off an honestly recorded marker, no forgery
required. Threat model, concession and bound: §8.3–§8.5 of the design note above.

`OpenReport` carries four embedder-related fields surfaced by EU-6
(camelCase per TS convention): `embedderDownloadMs`, `embedderEvents`,
`embedderMeanCenteringRequired`, and `embedderMeanVecPinned`. Each entry
in `embedderEvents` is a discriminated-union object: `kind` is one of
`"DefaultEmbedderDownload"`, `"DefaultEmbedderCacheHit"`,
`"MeanVecPinned"`; the remaining optional fields carry the variant
payload in camelCase.

EU-6 FIX-2 refined the `EmbedderEvent` type from a wide
`Option`-collapsed interface to a true discriminated union of
per-variant interfaces (`DefaultEmbedderDownloadEvent`,
`DefaultEmbedderCacheHitEvent`, `MeanVecPinnedEvent`) plus an
`UnknownEmbedderEvent` forward-compat fallback. The unknown member is
part of the published union for soundness: a future or replaced native
extension may emit kinds this build does not know about. Because the
fallback's `kind` field is the open type `string`, tsc cannot exclude
it purely from a literal `event.kind === "..."` check on the bare
union — gate the discriminant chain on `isKnownEmbedderEvent` first to
recover precise narrowing on the three known variants:

```typescript
import { Engine, isKnownEmbedderEvent } from "fathomdb";

const engine = await Engine.open(path, { useDefaultEmbedder: true });
const report = engine.openReport();
for (const event of report.embedderEvents) {
  if (isKnownEmbedderEvent(event)) {
    if (event.kind === "DefaultEmbedderDownload") {
      // tsc narrows: event.bytes is number, event.url is string.
      log(`downloaded ${event.bytes} bytes from ${event.url}`);
    } else if (event.kind === "MeanVecPinned") {
      log(`mean vec pinned at ${event.docCount} docs (dim=${event.dim})`);
    }
  } else {
    // `event` is `UnknownEmbedderEvent` — only `event.kind` is typed;
    // other fields are `unknown` via the index signature.
    log(`unknown embedder event kind: ${event.kind}`);
  }
}
```

The two-step pattern (guard, then discriminate) is required because
TS literal narrowing on a discriminated union cannot remove an open-
typed member from the union when the discriminant is a literal —
`"DefaultEmbedderDownload"` could equal *any* `string`, so the unknown
fallback stays in the narrowed type and widens payload field access to
`unknown`. The exported `isKnownEmbedderEvent` type guard excludes the
unknown member up front, and the inner `if (event.kind === "...")` chain
then narrows precisely to one variant interface.

### Shipped feature axis (EU-6 FIX-1)

Released `.node` binaries published to npm are compiled with the `default-embedder`
Cargo feature ON (see `src/ts/package.json`'s
`build:native` script, consumed by `release.yml`'s build-napi job), so
`useDefaultEmbedder: true` materialises a real bge-small embedder
against the published artifact without any extra install step. The no-
feature build path is preserved as a CI sanity check (informational
wheel-size signal on the minimal-deps tree), not a shipped artifact.

The `test-hooks` Cargo feature is dev-only and never ships: methods
like `writeVectorForTest` and the force-panic probe do not exist on
installed `.node` binaries. They are exposed only when the binding is
built via `npm run build:native:debug` (the script the vitest suite
uses). End-user callers should not rely on these symbols.

### Custom embedder implementations (deferred to 0.8.x)

Supplying a custom TypeScript `Embedder` implementation requires a
napi-rs callback bridge subject to ADR-0.6.0-embedder-protocol
Invariant 3 (no host-side log emission during `embed()`). That bridge
is a multi-slice campaign deferred to 0.8.x. In 0.7.1 the binding
surface is binary: `useDefaultEmbedder: true` (engine's bge-small) or
omitted/`false` (no embedder; vector writes reject with
`EmbedderNotConfiguredError`).

## `view` on `search` / `searchTextOnly` (0.8.20 Slice 15b fix-2)

**Status: PROPOSED / NOT SIGNED.**

Both search verbs take the SAME optional `view` argument the five read verbs
take, as a trailing options object.

```ts
engine.search(query, filter?, rerankDepth?, useGraphArm?, alpha?, poolN?,
              explain?, options?): Promise<SearchResult>
engine.searchTextOnly(query, options?): Promise<SearchResult>
```

`options` is `SearchOptions`: the exported `ReadView` shape plus optional
`limit`. It keeps the same validity fields `read.get` / `read.list` /
`graph.neighbors` accept (`camelCase` here, `snake_case` in Python).

- Omitted / `undefined` is the STRICT view: active-only, non-superseded, and
  valid AT QUERY TIME.
- `{ validAsOf: t }` evaluates validity at the bound instant `t` (INTEGER epoch
  SECONDS, UTC). Half-open, matching the write side and the read verbs:
  `t === validFrom` is IN, `t === validUntil` is OUT.
- `{ includeOutOfWindow: true }` returns hits whatever their window.

**Default behaviour change.** A node whose window has closed (or has not opened)
is no longer returned by a default `search`. This is a no-op on any corpus that
never authored a window: omitting the write fields lands NULL/NULL, and NULL is
unbounded, so every pre-existing row still matches.

**Axis scope — VALIDITY only.** `{ includeSuperseded: true }` and
`{ includeInactive: true }` reject with `InvalidArgumentError` on the search
path; they are REFUSED rather than silently ignored, because search hydrates
from projection indexes that are not version-complete. Use `read.list` to
enumerate history.

These are ARGUMENTS, not new verbs — the governed command surface
(`src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json`) is unchanged.

## Ranked result limits (0.8.22 Slice 18)

`SearchOptions` extends `ReadView` with optional `limit`, used as the final options argument
for `search`, `searchTextOnly`, and `searchProjectedText`. It defaults to 10. The legacy
`ReadView` shape remains accepted in that position. `graph.searchExpand` takes a final
`SearchExpandOptions` object with optional `searchLimit`, also defaulting to 10. Each value must
be an integer in `1..=100`; an out-of-range request rejects with `InvalidArgumentError` rather
than silently clamping. `graph.neighbors` retains its separate 50-result traversal cap.

### Direct FTS-only prefix stability (0.8.22 Slice 23)

`engine.searchTextOnly` does not embed, invoke vector retrieval, CE reranking, or graph
expansion. Matching node- and edge-body FTS candidates are deterministically body-deduplicated
and ranked before `options.limit` truncates the result. The node candidate input is fixed at 100,
so for the same immutable selection, query, and effective validity time, results at a smaller
accepted limit are the ordered prefix of results at a larger accepted limit. Cross-call
comparisons with `validAsOf` must use the same explicit instant; an omitted `validAsOf` resolves
per call. This guarantee does not extend to hybrid `engine.search` APIs.

## Nested-source projections (0.8.21 Slice 60)

`ProjectionSpec.source?: string[] | null` is a literal canonical-body member
path; omission keeps legacy top-level lookup. Missing/null terminals create no
row. Object/array terminals reject configuration backfill and writes atomically
with `WriteValidationError`.

`SearchFilter.attributes?: [string, string][]` is ordered AND equality over
declared `"filterable"` projections. Canonical text is intentional: projected
string `"1"` and number `1` both match `"1"`. `searchFilterToFilter` throws
`InvalidFilterError` for a non-empty attribute list rather than dropping it.

For a search invoked with its `explain` argument set to `true` and attribute predicates,
`result.explanation.trace.droppedEdgeHits` reports edge-FTS candidates rejected
solely by the node-scoped attribute rule. The default non-explain path does not
collect this count.

`engine.searchProjectedText(query, name, filter?, view?)` searches only the
named declared `"searchable"` property-FTS projection, applying metadata,
validity, and attribute filters. It does not body-scan, invoke vectors, or fuse;
hits are text branch with no soft fallback or explanation.

## Non-presence

TypeScript does not expose recovery verbs or doctor-only flags. In particular,
there is no SDK equivalent of `recover`, `checkIntegrity`, `quick`, `full`, or
`roundTrip`. See `design/recovery.md`.
