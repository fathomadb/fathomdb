# Plans

`dev/plans/` is the home for **per-release implementation planning and
execution artifacts** across every shipped and in-flight FathomDB release line
(0.6.0 → 0.6.1 → 0.7.0 → 0.7.1 → 0.7.2 → 0.8.x). It is an **append-only
historical record**, not a workspace that gets pruned per release.

## Layout

- `<version>-implementation.md` — per-release single source of truth for the
  implementation sequence, execution posture, and phase/pack status
  (`0.6.0-implementation.md`, `0.7.0-implementation.md`,
  `0.7.1-implementation.md`, …).
- `../progress/<version>.md` — chronological work log per release line.
- `prompts/` — execution prompts used for slice/packet work, one file per
  slice (e.g. `0.7.2-PR-8-campaign-closure.md`).
- `runs/` — slice logs, reviewer notes, and status boards
  (e.g. `STATUS-0.8.4.md`, `0.8.4-gating-rerun-RESULT.md`). Distilled experiment
  results of record now live in `dev/experiments-ledger.md`; transient per-run
  artifacts (raw `*-output.json`, codex `*-review-*` logs, `.log`) have been pruned
  and are recoverable from git history.

Directory split:

- `dev/plans/` = release execution planning + run artifacts (all versions).
- `dev/roadmap/` = forward-looking, not-yet-scheduled backlog and deferrals.

## Current authority

Do not infer the active release from this directory or the staleness table.
The one live release is selected by `dev/plans/release-state-*.json`; read its
`board` and `plan` keys, then use the named `STATUS-<version>.md` board. Do
not declare a fixed current release in this index: a draft plan is not a live
release until a release-state file names it.

## Archive convention (in place — do NOT relocate)

Completed-release prompts and run artifacts are **archived in place**, not moved
to a subdirectory. This is deliberate: artifacts are cross-referenced **by path**
from ADRs, design docs, implementation docs, and prior run logs (≈120 distinct
prompt paths are referenced from ≈140 files as of 0.7.2). Physically relocating
a completed prompt would break those references or force rewrites of immutable
historical run logs. Instead:

- A prompt/run artifact is "archived" when its release line has shipped; its
  status lives in that release's `STATUS-*.md` / `*-implementation.md` ledger,
  not in its filesystem location.
- The active to-do surface is the board named by the live release-state JSON,
  not a scan of `prompts/`.
- Do not delete or move shipped-release artifacts. If a path must change, update
  every inbound reference in the same change and leave a note in the ledger.

## Staleness index (which lines are live vs archived-in-place)

Per the archive convention above, completed-release plans/prompts stay in place.
**Treat everything for a shipped line as historical — the project has moved on and
details may be STALE.** For distilled experiment results, read
`dev/experiments-ledger.md`; for current state, `dev/DOC-INDEX.md`.

| Release line | Status | Plans/prompts here |
|--------------|--------|--------------------|
| 0.6.0, 0.6.1 | shipped | **ARCHIVED in place — stale** |
| 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2 | shipped | **ARCHIVED in place — stale** |
| 0.8.0, 0.8.1, 0.8.2, 0.8.3 | shipped/closed | **ARCHIVED in place — stale** |
| 0.8.4 | closed (GraphRAG SPLIT; Fork E re-opened) | **ARCHIVED in place** — see `dev/experiments-ledger.md` |
| 0.8.5 | historical | Retained in place; consult the live release-state JSON for current work. |
| 0.8.23 | shipped/closed | Retained in place; resolve live work through the release-state lookup rule. |
| 0.8.24 | draft feature planning | Prework Slices 0–7 are complete; Slices 10–70 have draft plans but no live release-state record. |

Transient per-run artifacts (raw `*-output.json`, codex `*-review-*` logs, `.log`,
checkpoints) under `runs/` were pruned by the ledger-prune (`scripts/repo-prune/prompts/prune-docs.md`) and are
recoverable from git history ≤ `25541d88`; their results live in `dev/experiments-ledger.md`.

## Rules

- Active source-of-truth and in-flight slice artifacts: keep in this directory.
- Completed-release prompts and run logs: keep in place (see archive convention);
  their stale/archived status is the staleness index above, not their filesystem location.
- Future-release backlog or deliberate deferral beyond the active line:
  `dev/roadmap/`.
