# FathomDB 0.8.22 — cross-platform stable release

## Goal and scope

0.8.22 makes native Python and npm delivery stable on Linux glibc x64/ARM64,
macOS x64/ARM64, and Windows x64. Linux musl, Windows ARM/32-bit, and all
other target triples remain unsupported.

The main `fathomdb` npm package publishes under `next` first. It is promoted
to `latest` only after every platform's actual-runner registry smoke and the
co-tagging check pass. Platform packages stay on `next`.

This release also prepares the next scale-bound release without making a
scale claim: it records the current documentation authority/debt inventory
and pre-registers the future measurement protocol. Neither preparatory slice
executes a scale run, changes a supported-scale statement, nor authorizes a
publication.

It also makes ranked retrieval cardinality explicit before publication. The
default result count is 10 and the validated maximum is 100 for the direct
ranked-search families. This closes the existing unbounded FTS result paths and
makes EARP's `K = 20` and `K = 50` measurements accessible through public SDKs.

Before publication, the release also repairs canonical FTS hydration, makes
projection readiness truthful for sessions without safe dense runtime support,
and adds a governed pure-read projection-status surface. Detailed contracts are
in the Slice 19, 21, and 22 plans and designs; publication remains held until
all three have landed and its existing gate is explicitly resumed.

Before the held publication step, Slice 23 repaired direct FTS-only
limit-prefix instability. A larger caller result limit no longer silently
changes the smaller direct-text top-K under the same snapshot. The repair is
deliberately limited to that path; broader hybrid/vector candidate-fanout
semantics are a 0.8.23 architecture/documentation follow-up.

## Requirements and acceptance criteria

- The manifest, loader, npm metadata, and publish job agree on exactly five
  supported triples.
- The main package injects exactly one version-locked optional dependency for
  each supported platform package; unsupported hosts retain a clear error.
- Python wheels and napi binaries build and registry-smoke on actual target
  runners for every triple.
- A trusted-publishing bootstrap exists for each new npm package and relies on
  GitHub OIDC, never a long-lived npm token. Non-Windows packages are unscoped
  `fathomdb-<triple>` names; Windows x64 MSVC is
  `fathomdb-native-win32-x64-msvc`.
- The immutable candidate passes dry-run and full CI. A failed platform smoke
  leaves `latest` untouched and the version recoverable from its tag.
- A two-phase `repo-prune` classification records current authorities and
  document debt without deleting, moving, or silently rewriting historical
  records.
- The 0.8.23 scale-bound measurement protocol is pre-registered with fixture
  identity, dependency/toolchain/hardware capture, repetitions, metrics, and
  result-artifact schema; it explicitly records that no scale measurement or
  supported-scale claim has been made.
- Ranked `search`, `search_text_only`, and `search_projected_text` default to
  10 results, accept a caller-selected result limit through 100, and reject an
  out-of-range request rather than silently clamping it.
- `search_expand.search_hits` uses the same `search_limit` contract; graph
  expansion retains its separate 50-per-root traversal cap.
- Body and edge FTS hydration use unconditional canonical `write_cursor`
  indexes with planner-shape proof; projected-text retains its applicable
  active-node partial index.
- A declared vector projection reports `unavailable` when dense runtime is
  absent or not safety-approved, and a safe later open repairs eligible stranded
  work without reopening failed terminals or duplicating embedding.
- A governed projection-status read reports runtime availability and its reason,
  corpus-wide per-projection dense readiness, and declaration-scoped unsupported
  kinds without configuration side effects.
- Under one immutable snapshot, direct `search_text_only` results at a smaller
  accepted limit are an ordered prefix of results at a larger accepted limit.
  The implementation uses bounded, caller-limit-independent direct-text
  candidate collection; this guarantee does not extend to hybrid search.

### Slices 19, 21, and 22 — retrieval and projection truth

Slice 19 is an index-only schema step with focused `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` proof;
it does not add an edge-FTS SQL result limit. Slice 21 is a governed public
behavior change and begins only after its readiness decision record and pickup
review; it adds no schema step. Slice 22 begins only after Slice 21 and its own
governed-read decision; it is a pure status read, not a configuration echo.

**Slices 19, 21, and 22 LANDED on `origin/main` at `e95afd29` through PR #207.**
Slice 19's reviewed source range ends at `550c4b03`. The fixture-scoped closure record at
`dev/plans/runs/0.8.22-slice-19-join-index-measurement-20260808.json` retains
the reproducible migration, ingest, and affected-query samples; protected-branch
landing is complete, while publication remains held.

**Slice 21's reviewed implementation ends at `26bdd2ce`, followed by the
test-only cross-SDK contract correction ending at `ae873e1a`.** Its independent
review closed FIX-1 through FIX-5, the correction closed through FIX-3, and the
refreshed default-embedder and full verify CI jobs passed before landing.

**Slice 22's reviewed implementation ends at `6aeee48e`.** Its signed C5
preparation, RED and GREEN implementation, and FIX-1 re-review closed all
P1/P2. Isolated all-tier verification, full workspace clippy/check, and the
refreshed protected-branch CI passed before landing.

**Slice 22 LANDED on `origin/main` at `e95afd29`.** This explicit closure
witness is retained for dependent-slice preflight.

The corresponding plans require RED→GREEN evidence, cross-SDK conformance
where the public contract changes, an independent review, and the normal local
verification gates. They do not authorize a tag, registry write, or publication.

### Slice 23 — FTS-LIMIT-PREFIX-STABILITY

HITL ruling `seq-248` classified direct FTS limit-dependent top-K contents as a
P2 defect. Slice 23 fixed only `search_text_only` and its `ReadView` form:
under the same snapshot, every accepted smaller result list must be the ordered
prefix of the corresponding larger result list. It uses a fixed bounded node
candidate collection of 100, then existing fusion and final caller-limit
truncation. It proved the mechanism with an adversarial real-database node/edge
duplicate fixture, Python/TypeScript wrapper tests, a paired public path
measurement record, corrected interface/public API docs, RED→GREEN commits,
and independent code review.

Hybrid/vector candidate-fanout behavior is expressly excluded. Slice 23 added
no API spelling, schema step, graph change, reranker change, or edge-FTS cap.
PR #209 landed it at `f1ccf2694087e1da4cee2204fe7b80389420a4b0` after CI run
`31265399431` passed. Publication remains explicitly held.

### Slice 12 — DOC-BASELINE

Run the existing two-phase `repo-prune` classifier against the candidate and
commit a bounded inventory of current authority, historical records, and
document debt. The inventory must identify each proposed follow-up's owner and
release home. Historical records stay in place; this slice neither deletes nor
moves documents, rewrites their content, or broadens Markdown/link validation.

Acceptance is a reproducible classifier command, a versioned inventory with
source revision/provenance, and a reviewable distinction between current
authority, historical record, and unresolved debt. It must be useful to the
0.8.23 architecture/contract-baseline work without pre-deciding that work.

### Slice 17 — SCALE-PROTOCOL

Pre-register, but do not execute, the 0.8.23 supported-scale characterization.
The protocol must pin the candidate revision and corpus/fixture identity;
record dependency-lock, schema, toolchain, CPU/GPU, and host-capacity evidence;
specify repetitions, warm/cold treatment, metrics and percentile summaries;
and define the result-artifact schema and interpretation rules.

It must state that the protocol has no measured result, creates no supported
scale limit, and cannot satisfy either the 0.8.23 advisory or 0.8.24 firm
scale-bound outcome. Execution remains after the complete 0.8.22 dependency
stack, including the coupled vector migration.

### Slice 18 — RETRIEVAL-LIMITS

Implement the accepted ranked-result contract in
`dev/design/retrieval-result-limits.md`: default to 10 hits, accept a requested
limit through 100, and reject invalid requests rather than silently clamping
them. The scope is hybrid search, text-only search, projected-text search, and
the initial `search_hits` result of `search_expand`, across Rust, Python, and
TypeScript.

The slice must prove the default, `K = 5/20/50`, the maximum, and invalid
boundary behavior on all three layers. It must also prove that vector rerank
depth follows the requested K, and that FTS/filter ordering cannot return fewer
valid hits because filtered candidates consumed the limit. Traversal expansion
and enumerative read limits are expressly out of scope: `graph_neighbors` keeps
its current 50-per-root cap, and `read_list`/operational-log pagination retain
their own policies.

## Reserved-gap policy

Slices 12 and 17 are authorized reserved-gap preparatory work: they establish
the current documentation baseline and the future scale-measurement protocol.
They do not widen the supported target matrix, imply future package promises,
or authorize a scale measurement or publication. Unsupported targets remain
explicitly unsupported.

## Cross-cutting DoD

Every implemented slice must retain the five-target capability truth across
the manifest, native artifact, package metadata, loader, actual-runner smoke,
and public documentation. Changes to public API or error taxonomy require their
own governing decision.

Every slice ends with independent code review. A P1 or P2 finding requires a
named `FIX-n` correction and focused re-review, repeated until no P1 or P2
remains; a P0 is addressed immediately. This closure rule also applies to
code-bearing preparation and release-safety work, while operational publication
steps retain their existing real-registry smoke gates.

Before any 0.8.22 completion claim, perform an independent documentation
correctness review against the final implementation and release witnesses. It
must cover the release-state JSON, rendered plan and STATUS board, affected
`dev/` design/interface/run records, and affected public `docs/` sources.
Correct material drift, then run the relevant documentation checks. Passing
code or CI alone is not a completion claim.

## Publish authority

Tagging and publication require normal explicit HITL authorization. This plan
prepares and verifies the release path; it does not authorize a registry write.
