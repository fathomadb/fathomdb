========================================================================
PLAN AUTHORING TEMPLATE  (this comment block is harmless if left in)
Copy to dev/plans/plan-<release>.md and replace every {{PLACEHOLDER}}.
This is the *deliverable* side of the system; the *method* is the
release-independent runbook dev/design/orchestration.md. A plan written
from this template is meant to be driven by `/goal complete <release>`
as an orchestrator session (prompts/0.8.x-RELEASE-ORCHESTRATOR-HANDOFF.md).

Required fills:
  {{RELEASE}}      e.g. 0.8.6
  {{THEME}}        one line: what this release is FOR
  {{GOAL}}         2-5 bullets: the deliverables this release lands
  {{QUALITY_REVIEW}} how the quality testing roadmap applies or is deferred
  {{REQS}}         the R-* requirement rows + their acceptance signals
  {{LADDER}}       the mod-5 slice rows (number, title, work-type, depends-on)
  {{OVERRIDE_REG}} verified file:line sources that diverge (or "none found")
  {{BEHAVIOR_REG}} every silent behavior change this release ships
  {{PREREQS}}      what must be true before Slice 0 opens
  {{DECISIONS}}    decisions already taken (with date + rationale)
  {{OPEN_Q}}       questions that need HITL before/at a gate
  {{NEXT}}         the immediate next slice pointer

PLAN AUTHORING CHECKLIST — a plan is GREAT when each item below is true.
(The slice-authoring checklist defeats under-spec at the slice level;
this one defeats it at the plan level — the gaps an orchestrator only
discovers mid-release.)
  [ ] Every requirement has a FALSIFIABLE, OFFLINE acceptance signal — a
      command/test/witness, not "works". (§ 2). No R-* without one.
  [ ] Every slice traces to a requirement (R-* / G-gap / OPP-id) AND a
      DoD; no orphan slices, no requirement without a slice (§ 3, § 5).
  [ ] Keystones & hard gates named: which slice gates which later slice
      or release, and which transitions are HITL-gated (§ 3).
  [ ] Parallelizable tracks called out with their shared-file conflicts,
      so worktrees don't collide (§ 3).
  [ ] The override/duplication register is filled from a real grep — every
      divergent source of a contract is listed at file:line, or the row
      says "none found" after looking (§ 8). Don't leave it blank-by-default.
  [ ] The behavior-change register lists EVERY silent change (default
      flip, schema bump, error-shape change) → each becomes a changelog
      line. "No silent changes" is a claim you must have checked (§ 9).
  [ ] Cross-cutting DoD (X1 SDK parity + harness, X2 mkdocs, X3 docs +
      DOC-INDEX) is stated as binding EVERY slice (§ 6).
  [ ] Prerequisites are concrete and checkable (a prior release CLOSED +
      docs reconciled; worktree hygiene), not aspirational (§ 7).
  [ ] Reserved-gap policy is stated (gaps are the insertion mechanism;
      HALT on overflow), so follow-on work has a home (§ 4).
  [ ] Decisions taken and open questions are recorded ON THE PLAN, with
      dates — not left in chat (§ 10, § 11). Chat is throwaway.
  [ ] Footprint stated: where does each piece run (in-library CPU-only vs
      caller-side BYO-LLM vs CI), and is the library query path still
      deterministic/CPU-only? (header).
  [ ] Read `dev/notes/fathomdb-quality-testing-roadmap.md` and record which
      recommendations fit this release, which are deferred, and what new
      evidence changes the assessment (§ 1). Consultation adds no gate.

# FathomDB {{RELEASE}} — Plan (state-machine ladder) · **{{THEME}}**

> **Plan-as-state-machine.** Mod-5 slice ladder + reserved-gap policy + the live
> "Immediate Next Slice" pointer. Authoritative slice contracts graduate to
> `{{RELEASE}}-implementation.md`; live state lives in `runs/STATUS-{{RELEASE}}.md`.
> Method (roles, state spine, preflight, decision loop, recovery) is the
> release-independent runbook `dev/design/orchestration.md`. Run via
> `/goal complete {{RELEASE}}` as an **orchestrator** session
> (`prompts/0.8.x-RELEASE-ORCHESTRATOR-HANDOFF.md`).
>
> **Theme.** {{THEME — one paragraph: what this release is for and why now.}}
>
> **Footprint.** {{Where each piece runs — in-library CPU-only / caller-side
> BYO-LLM / CI. Confirm the library query path stays CPU-only/deterministic.}}

---

## 1. Goal & scope

{{GOAL — 2-5 bullets. Each: the deliverable, the requirement it satisfies, and
*why it belongs in this release* (especially why-first for a keystone).}}

**Out of scope (deferred):** {{what is explicitly NOT in this release, and the
release/slice it is deferred to. Deferral is a deliberate decision, not "too hard".}}

**Quality strategy review.** {{QUALITY_REVIEW — after reading
`dev/notes/fathomdb-quality-testing-roadmap.md`, name the testing practices
this release adopts, defers, or revises, with reasons tied to its change rate,
owned failure modes and available capacity. Do not turn recommendations into
automatic release gates.}}

---

## 2. Requirements + acceptance criteria (release DoD — frozen at Slice 0)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance signal (falsifiable, offline) |
|----|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| R-{{X}}-1 | {{requirement}} | {{a command / test / on-disk witness that proves it — RED→GREEN, byte-identity, conformance enumeration, CI dry-run, etc.}} |
| R-{{X}}-2 | {{…}} | {{…}} |

{{New ACs (if minted): candidates **AC-NNN+** at Slice 0 (…) and at Slice 40
(release-readiness), per the locked-acceptance policy in § 6.}}

---

## 3. Slice ladder (mod-5)

```text
0 → 5 → 10 → 15 → 20 → 40
```

| Slice | Title | Work-type | Depends-on |
|------:|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **0** | Setup + ADR Kickoff — board + plan triad; the load-bearing ADR(s); policy confirmation | design-adr | — |
| **5** | **{{KEYSTONE}}** — {{…}} | implementation | 0 |
| **…** | {{…}} | {{implementation \| verification \| research \| experiment \| release-op}} | {{…}} |
| **40** | **Verification + Release Readiness** — X1/X2/X3 + R-* AC gate {{+ dry-run publish}} | verification | {{…}} |

**Keystones / hard gates.** {{which slice gates which later slice or release; which
transition is HITL-gated and why — e.g. a backlog push, a default flip.}}

**Tracks (parallelizable).** {{track A ∥ track B ∥ track C}}; name the shared
editable files (e.g. `pyproject.toml`, schema) that force serialization. Each track
is an independent worktree — preflight every spawn (`orchestration.md § 1.6`).

---

## 4. Reserved-gap policy (carried, unchanged)

Planned slices are multiples of 5; gaps `1–4, 6–9, …` are the insertion mechanism
for unplanned follow-on a slice reveals. A reserved-gap slice (N+1…N+4) is **fully
orchestrated** (own prompt, own worktree off a fresh `main` baseline, own
`output.json`, own codex § 9, own CLOSED block) — not an ad-hoc patch. **HALT rule:**
if a gap band fills and follow-on remains, the slice was mis-scoped → HALT to HITL;
never overflow into the next mod-5 number. (Full statement: `0.8.1-plan.md` § Numbering.)

---

## 5. Cross-cutting Definition of Done (X1/X2/X3 — bind EVERY slice)

- **X1 — SDK parity + functional harnesses.** Any surface/behavior/error/result
  change lands in **both** Py and TS SDKs in the same slice, each with a live
  functional harness (not symbol presence), incl. cross-binding equivalence.
- **X2 — `mkdocs build` stays green.** Any `docs/` add/rename updates `mkdocs.yml`
  nav same-slice; Slice 40 enforces it as a release gate.
- **X3 — docs updated per slice + `dev/DOC-INDEX.md` maintained** in the closing
  docs commit.

`runs/STATUS-{{RELEASE}}.md` carries an X1/X2/X3 per-slice column.

---

## 6. Acceptance-criteria policy (carried)

`dev/acceptance.md` stays **locked** (`acceptance-md-locked-no-feature-acs`). Slices
track work by G-gap / OPP-id + TDD test names, NOT invented AC ids. New ACs
(AC-NNN+) are minted **only at gated slices** (Slice 0 conformance, Slice 40
release-readiness), decided HITL.

---

## 7. Prerequisites (before any slice opens)

1. **{{Prior release}} closed** and its docs reconciled — this line baselines off the
   `main` that carries {{the prior keystone}}.
2. **Worktree hygiene:** pre-create + verify each slice worktree off
   `$(git rev-parse main)` and run `scripts/preflight.sh --worktree <wt>`
   (`agent-worktree-stale-base-trap`, `orchestration.md § 1.6`); GPU/maturin builds
   happen on the MAIN tree only.

---

## 8. Override / duplication register (verified file:line)

Every place a single contract has **divergent sources** that could drift — a config
key defined twice, a default declared in two layers, a schema duplicated across
bindings. Fill from a real grep; this register is the anti-drift surface for the
release. If you looked and found none, say so.

| # | Concept | Divergent sources (file:line) | Live consequence if they drift |
|--:|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | {{e.g. CE-rerank α default}} | {{rust: …:NN · py: …:NN · ts: …:NN}} | {{what breaks}} |

{{OVERRIDE_REG — or: "Reviewed <date>; no divergent contract sources found in scope."}}

---

## 9. Behavior-change register (every silent change → a changelog line)

Each row is a behavior an existing consumer could notice (a default flip, a schema
bump, a changed error shape, a new required field). Every row must become a
`docs/changelog` entry by Slice 40. "No silent changes" is a claim you must have
checked, not a default.

| # | Change | Who notices | Changelog entry |
|--:|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | {{…}} | {{consumer / SDK caller / operator}} | {{the line that ships}} |

{{BEHAVIOR_REG — or: "Reviewed <date>; this release ships no consumer-visible
behavior change (mechanism/CI only)."}}

---

## 10. Decisions taken (recorded)

- {{YYYY-MM-DD}} — {{decision}} · rationale: {{…}} ({{HITL / ADR ref / memory}}).

---

## 11. Open questions for the human (HITL)

1. {{question}} — options + recommendation; which slice/gate it blocks.

---

## 12. Out-of-band / parallel notes

- {{other releases or tracks running concurrently; shared-file conflicts; budget
  notes — e.g. "$0, mechanism-only, can run beside the experiment program".}}

## 13. Immediate next slice

**Slice 0 — Setup + ADR Kickoff.** {{NEXT — stand up `runs/STATUS-{{RELEASE}}.md`
(mirror STATUS-0.8.2 shape), draft the load-bearing ADR, confirm policy. Then fan
out Slices … ∥ … ∥ …}}
