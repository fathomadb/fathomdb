title: 0.6.0 Requirements
date: 2026-04-27
target_release: 0.6.0
desc: User-visible needs + explicit non-goals for 0.6.0 rewrite
blast_radius: every public API surface; acceptance.md (1:1 mapping); test-plan.md (every REQ → ≥1 AC → ≥1 test); architecture.md (no orphan subsystems); design/* (each subsystem traces to ≥1 REQ)
status: locked
---

# Requirements

User-visible outcomes only. Each entry is a single, falsifiable statement
about what an operator, application caller, or release process can
observe — never an implementation verb. Each entry traces to ≥1 source
from `learnings.md` § "Raw requirement candidates" or to an accepted ADR.

`acceptance.md` issues one or more `AC-NNN` per REQ in Phase 3b. Drafted
from `learnings.md`; critic-pass amendments applied 2026-04-27.

Numbering: stable; do not renumber. Removed entries leave their REQ id
retired. Where a REQ has been split or reworked post-critic, the original
id range is preserved with `a / b / c` suffixes.

When a REQ contains a numerical target, an accepted ADR is the
authoritative source for the number; the REQ restates it for traceability
and may not diverge.

## Observability (REQ-001..REQ-008)

- **REQ-001 — Lifecycle phase attribution.** Operator can attribute any
  visible delay to a specific lifecycle phase (started / slow / heartbeat /
  finished / failed) without parsing stderr.
  _Source:_ `dev/design-response-cycle-feedback.md` Core Correctness Rule.
  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-async-surface (engine sync surface frames the
  lifecycle the operator sees).

- **REQ-002 — Host logging integration.** Operator owns subscriber
  configuration; fathomdb writes no log files of its own and emits all
  diagnostic events through whatever subscriber the host has registered
  in its language.
  _Source:_ `dev/design-logging-and-tracing.md` Principle 2.

- **REQ-003 — Cumulative engine counters.** Operator can read cumulative
  engine counters (queries, writes, write rows, errors by code, admin
  ops, cache hit/miss) on demand at any time without per-operation
  overhead.
  _Source:_ `dev/design-note-telemetry-and-profiling.md` Level 0.

- **REQ-004 — Per-statement profiling opt-in.** Operator can opt into
  per-statement profiling (wall-clock, statement-internal step counters,
  cache delta) without rebuilding the engine.
  _Source:_ `dev/design-note-telemetry-and-profiling.md` Level 1.

- **REQ-005 — SQLite-internal events surfaced.** Operator receives
  SQLite-internal corruption / recovery / I/O events through the same
  channel as fathomdb's own diagnostics.
  _Source:_ `dev/design-logging-and-tracing.md` Principle 5.

- **REQ-006a — Slow-statement signal.** Statements exceeding a
  configurable threshold (default 100 ms) are surfaced to the operator.
  _Source:_ `dev/design-note-telemetry-and-profiling.md` § Slow statement
  detection.

- **REQ-006b — Slow signal feeds lifecycle attribution.** The slow-statement
  signal contributes to the "slow" lifecycle transition surfaced under
  REQ-001.
  _Source:_ same as REQ-006a.

- **REQ-007 — Stress-failure context sufficiency.** Stress / robustness
  test failures carry enough context to identify thread group, kind, last
  error, and projection state without re-running the failure. (Field-set
  enumeration owned by `acceptance.md` per HITL F14.)
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/design-retrieval-robustness-performance-gates-2026-04-23.md`
  § Observability Requirements.

- **REQ-008 — Vector-pending vs vector-failed distinguishability.**
  Operator can distinguish "vector work pending" from "vector work failed"
  via projection status; semantic-search timeout is interpretable by mode.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/design-projection-freshness-sli-harness-2026-04-23.md`
  § Failure Interpretation.

## Performance (REQ-009..REQ-018)

Absolute targets; not deltas vs 0.5.x. ADRs / `acceptance.md` own gates,
tolerances, warmups, sample counts, and other acceptance-level parameters.
`test-plan.md` owns benchmark corpora, fixtures, harnesses, and executable
protocol wiring. Requirements lock blocks on `test-plan.md` fixture specs
landing first — no perf REQ is executable without them. Reference target =
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` unless an ADR or AC names a different platform.

Numerical targets in this section are restatements of accepted ADRs;
the ADR is authoritative.

- **REQ-009a — Write throughput @ 1 KB ≥ 1,000 commits/sec** (sequential
  `WriteTx` commits, single client, `synchronous=NORMAL`, no projection
  load).

  no projection-style staleness window applies to canonical rows.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/design-projection-freshness-sli-harness-2026-04-23.md`
  (canonical+FTS committed inside writer tx).

- **REQ-014 — FTS-search freshness within the write transaction.**
  FTS searches after a write commit reflect that write synchronously.
  _Source:_ same as REQ-013.

- **REQ-017 — Mixed-retrieval stress workload keeps read p99 within
  `max(10 × baseline, 150 ms)`.**
  _Source:_ same as REQ-016.

- **REQ-018 — Reads do not serialize behind a single reader connection.**
  _Source:_ user-need preserved from `dev/design-reader-connection-pool.md`
  (dropped doc); concurrent-read SLI implied by ADR-0.6.0-retrieval-latency-gates'
  workload definition.

## Reliability (REQ-019..REQ-031)

- **REQ-019 — Zero `SQLITE_SCHEMA` warnings under concurrent reads + admin
  DDL.**
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.5.7-corrected-scope.md` T1 §4.

  `Engine.close()` releases the database file lock and all FDs the
  engine opened.

  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-async-surface (sync surface — close is
  blocking on join).

- **REQ-020b — Host process exits ≤ 5 s of close.** Host process exits
  within 5 seconds of `Engine.close()` returning.
  _Source:_ memory `feedback_release_verification`.

  process exits within 5 seconds even when engine instances are not
  explicitly `close()`d.
  _Source:_ commit `b4fe850` (0.5.6 atexit Memex regression); HITL F8
  lifecycle lift.

- **REQ-022a — `DatabaseLocked` rejection on second open.** Second
  engine on the same DB file is rejected with a typed `DatabaseLocked`
  error while the first holds it, including while pending vector work
  exists.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/design-retrieval-robustness-performance-gates-2026-04-23.md`
  Test Set 3; `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` POST 8.
  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-single-writer-thread.

- **REQ-022b — Second-open never corrupts state.** A rejected second
  open leaves the database file unmodified.
  _Source:_ same as REQ-022a.

- **REQ-023 — No deadlock on engine drop with pending vector work.**
  _Source:_ same as REQ-022a.

- **REQ-024 — `fathomdb doctor safe-export` covers committed WAL-backed state.** Never
  regresses to file-copy semantics.
  _Source:_ `dev/production-acceptance-bar.md`.

- **REQ-025a — Recovered databases preserve canonical rows.**
  _Source:_ `dev/production-acceptance-bar.md`.

- **REQ-025b — Recovery restores FTS usability.**
  _Source:_ same as REQ-025a.

- **REQ-025c — Recovery preserves vector profile metadata + table
  capability** (for vector-enabled DBs).
  _Source:_ same as REQ-025a.

- **REQ-026 — `excise_source` preserves auditability and leaves
  projections consistent.**
  _Source:_ `dev/production-acceptance-bar.md`.

- **REQ-027 — Canonical writes never blocked by projection unavailability**
  (FTS or vector).
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Essentials §13.

- **REQ-028a — No-embedder-wired hard-errors at call boundary.**
  Calling a vector-requiring operation with no embedder configured
  hard-errors at the call boundary; never silent-degrades.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Essentials §12.

- **REQ-028b — Kind-not-vector-indexed hard-errors at call boundary.**
  _Source:_ same as REQ-028a.

- **REQ-028c — Embedder dimension mismatch hard-errors at call
  boundary.**
  _Source:_ same as REQ-028a.
  _Cross-cite all three:_ ADR-0.6.0-vector-identity-embedder-owned.

- **REQ-029 — Hybrid retrieval surfaces a soft-fallback signal** when a
  non-essential branch could not contribute. (Field name owned by
  binding-interface ADRs.)
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Essentials §5.

- **REQ-030 — Tests and batch ingest can request bounded completion of
  background work**, with explicit timeout, through an `Engine` instance
  method rather than a sixth top-level SDK verb. (Method spelling owned by
  binding interfaces.)
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Essentials §14.
  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-async-surface Invariant A.

- **REQ-031 — Bounded provenance growth.** Operator can configure or
  trigger retention on provenance event tables; engine does not grow
  these tables unboundedly under steady-state writes.
  _Source:_ `dev/design-provenance-retention.md`.

- **REQ-031b — Zero corruption on power-cut.** Up to 100 ms of
  final-commit loss on power-cut acceptable; zero commit loss on
  OS-crash.
  _Source:_ ADR-0.6.0-durability-fsync-policy.

- **REQ-031c — Recovery time ≤ 2 s for a 1 GB DB at `Engine.open`** after
  unclean shutdown. Measured from process start to first accepted write
  transaction.
  _Source:_ ADR-0.6.0-durability-fsync-policy.

- **REQ-031d — Refuse-to-open on detected corruption.** `Engine.open`
  fails closed when corruption is detected at any open-path stage
  (WAL replay, header/format probe, schema probe, corrupt stored
  embedder-profile state). Failure
  surfaces as a structured `EngineOpenError::Corruption` carrying
  kind / stage / locator / `RecoveryHint { code, doc_anchor }`. The
  engine MUST NOT auto-truncate, auto-rebuild, auto-replay-with-skip,
  or auto-degrade to read-only. Recovery is reachable exclusively via
  the separate `fathomdb recover` CLI tool (consistent with REQ-037,
  REQ-054). On failure, no `Engine` handle is returned; the exclusive
  WAL lock is released; no SQLite connection is retained; no writer
  thread is spawned; no scheduler runs.
  _Source:_ ADR-0.6.0-corruption-open-behavior. _Cross-cite:_
  ADR-0.6.0-error-taxonomy (variant table extension);
  ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope (recovery CLI surface).

## Security (REQ-032..REQ-035)

- **REQ-032 — No network listener, no wire protocol.** All access is
  in-process or local subprocess; no TLS / auth / authz surface to
  misconfigure.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Essentials §17 +
  Anti-requirements; `dev/design-note-encryption-at-rest-in-motion.md` §2.

- **REQ-033 — No implicit network fetch on `Engine.open`.** Engine never
  downloads or hosts embedder model weights; embedder is supplied by
  the caller.
  **Exception (default embedder only, opt-in).** When the caller opts
  into the default embedder by passing `use_default_embedder=true` (or
  by selecting it explicitly at construction), the engine MAY download
  the single declared default-embedder weight set from a fixed URL set
  on first use, cache it under the platform user-cache directory,
  verify by sha256, and load it. This exception is scoped to: (a) the
  single named default-embedder identity recorded in the workspace;
  (b) weight files referenced by sha256 in the published
  `fathomdb-embedder` crate; (c) no other model, no arbitrary URL, no
  user-controllable model name. Caller-supplied embedders remain
  caller-owned per the unchanged rule. The first-use download path
  SHALL emit a structured `default_embedder_download` event in
  `OpenReport.embedder_events` describing url + bytes + sha256 +
  cache-path, so the wire/disk activity is visible.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` § Anti-requirements
  (embedder model hosting). _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-default-embedder;
  ADR-0.7.1-default-embedder-weight-fetch (exception).

- **REQ-034 — FTS5 injection-safe text queries.** Agent / LLM-generated
  text queries cannot inject FTS5 control syntax; safe grammar tokenises
  at parse time and never passes raw input to FTS5.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Essentials §3 +
  Architecture § Query execution.

- **REQ-035 — `fathomdb doctor safe-export` artifact verifiable end-to-end.** Operator
  can verify a safe-export artifact via an SHA-256 manifest written
  alongside it.
  _Source:_ `dev/production-acceptance-bar.md` (current production
  control; harvest evidence). Design treatment in
  `dev/design-note-encryption-at-rest-in-motion.md` (deferred-doc).

## Operability (REQ-036..REQ-041)

- **REQ-036 — Two-root operator CLI: `recover` (lossy) + `doctor` (bit-preserving).**
  Operator recovers from physical, logical, or semantic corruption via a
  dedicated CLI without writing application code. Surface splits at the
  root by mutation semantics:
  - `fathomdb recover --accept-data-loss <sub-flag>...` — sole umbrella
    for any non-bit-preserving path. Sub-flags include `--truncate-wal`,
    `--rebuild-vec0`, `--rebuild-projections`, `--excise-source <id>`.
    (`--purge-logical-id` and `--restore-logical-id` deferred to 0.8.0
    per HITL 2026-05-24; originally deferred to 0.7.x per
    ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope 2026-05-16 amendment — see
    `dev/roadmap/0.8.0.md`.) The
    `--accept-data-loss` flag is mandatory; no default.
  - `fathomdb doctor <verb>` — read-only and bit-preserving only. Verbs:
    `check-integrity` (aggregator over R1 always-on + cheap-only tiers),
    `safe-export <out>`, `verify-embedder`, `trace --source-ref <id>`,
    `dump-schema`, `dump-row-counts`, `dump-profile`.
    Verb-level enumeration with concrete flag spelling + exit-code numbers
    lives in `interfaces/cli.md`; canonical verb table lives in
    `design/recovery.md`. `--json` is mandatory on every verb (REQ-024).
    Migrations are NOT a `doctor` verb — they run only inside `Engine.open`
    per REQ-042 / ADR-0.6.0-corruption-open-behavior § 5.
    _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` § Recovery tooling;
    `dev/dbim-playbook.md` §3, §11; HITL R3 (2026-04-30, conf 74%).
    _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope, ADR-0.6.0-corruption-open-behavior § 3,
    design/recovery.md, design/bindings.md § 1.

- **REQ-037 — Recovery tooling unreachable from runtime SDK.** Application
  callers cannot accidentally invoke the recovery surface — the REQ-054
  recovery-verb set (`recover`, `restore`, `repair`, `fix`, `rebuild`), nor
  `excise_source` or `safe_export`. These are **operator disaster-response**
  verbs and remain CLI-only. (REQ-054 is the surface-shape corollary.)

  **CARVE-OUT — lawful erasure is an application capability.** Deliberate,
  caller-initiated data-lifecycle erasure is **not** recovery, and IS exposed
  on the runtime SDK: `purge(logical_id)` for governed records (shipped
  0.8.19) and `erase_source(source_id)` for anonymous / doc-seeded content
  (0.8.20). These are **lifecycle** verbs — explicitly invoked, never
  reachable by accident — and they share one engine code path with the
  recovery seam. An application cannot discharge a legal erasure obligation
  through a CLI it is not shipped (the Python wheel declares no
  `[project.scripts]`; the npm package declares no `"bin"`).
  **AC-041 remains the enforcing test and remains GREEN** — it asserts an
  empty intersection with the REQ-054 five-name set, and neither lifecycle
  verb is a recovery name.

  _Note:_ `purge_logical_id` was struck from the forbidden list — shipped
  code (`fathomdb-py:1297`, `fathomdb-napi:1102`, 0.8.19) already
  contradicted it. This amendment **records reality rather than changing
  it**.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.5.7-corrected-scope.md` D2; rewrite-proposal
  § Recovery tooling. _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope;
  `dev/design/0.8.20-erasure-and-h-end-state-v4.md` §3.1 (carve-out,
  HITL-APPROVED 2026-07-12).

- **REQ-038 — Source-ref blast-radius enumeration.** Operator can
  `trace --source-ref <id>` to enumerate every canonical row produced
  by a given run / step / action before excision.
  _Source:_ `dev/dbim-playbook.md` §6, §11.

- **REQ-039 — Single `check-integrity` invocation reports all integrity
  classes.** Physical, logical, and semantic integrity reported in one
  operator call. (Specific check set owned by `design/recovery.md`.)
  _Source:_ `dev/dbim-playbook.md` §10.

- **REQ-040 — Physical recovery rebuilds projections from canonical
  state.** Recovery never trusts recovered FTS5 / sqlite-vec shadow
  tables. (Specific canonical-table set owned by `design/engine.md`.)
  _Source:_ `dev/dbim-playbook.md` §7.

- **REQ-041 — Single-file deploy.** Operator deploys one binary +
  one `.sqlite` path; no server, no network dependency. Sidecar
  artifacts auto-managed by the engine (`-wal`, `.lock`) live at the
  same path with documented suffixes; they are part of the database
  file set, not separate operator-managed inputs.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Essentials §17.
  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-vector-index-location,
  ADR-0.6.0-op-store-same-file,
  ADR-0.6.0-database-lock-mechanism (sidecar `.lock` interpretation;
  superseded 2026-05-02),
  ADR-0.6.0-database-lock-mechanism-reader-pool-revision (current
  contract; admits `-shm` as a normal WAL artifact during runtime).

## Upgrade / compatibility (REQ-042..REQ-046)

- **REQ-042 — Auto schema migrations on `Engine.open`.** No DBA step;
  open call reports applied version + per-step duration on completion
  **or failure**.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Essentials §16;
  `dev/design-logging-and-tracing.md` Tier 1/2.

- **REQ-043 — Hard-error on 0.5.x-shaped DB.** Opening a 0.5.x-shaped
  database with 0.6.0 hard-errors at POST naming the schema version
  seen, never silently attempts partial reads.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` POST 1 + § What
  happens to 0.5.x.

- **REQ-044 — Hard-error on embedder mismatch at re-open.** Re-opening
  a store with a differently-dimensioned or differently-identified
  embedder hard-errors at POST naming both sides.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` POST 3–4. _Cross-cite:_
  ADR-0.6.0-vector-identity-embedder-owned.

- **REQ-045 — Schema-migration accretion guard.** Every post-v1
  migration that adds a table or column names a table / column it
  removes (or documents why removal is impossible).
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` § Future
  schema-migration policy.

- **REQ-046a — No 0.5.x → 0.6.0 deprecation shims.**
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` § What we got wrong #5.
  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-no-shims-policy,
  ADR-0.6.0-deprecation-policy-0-5-names.

- **REQ-046b — Within-0.6.x breaks announced + removed in same release.**
  No multi-release deprecation cycles.
  _Source:_ same as REQ-046a. _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-no-shims-policy.

## Supply chain (REQ-047..REQ-052)

- **REQ-047 — Version-skew detected at resolution time.** Engine and
  sibling embedder packages share a `fathomdb-embedder-api` crate with
  a stable trait set; version-skewed installs are detected at
  resolution time, not at runtime.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` § Version-skew policy.

- **REQ-048 — Co-tagged sibling releases.** All three packages
  (`fathomdb`, `fathomdb-embedder`, `fathomdb-embedder-api`) tag and
  publish together every release even when content is unchanged.
  _Source:_ same as REQ-047.

- **REQ-049 — Single source of truth for version.** Cargo workspace and
  Python pyproject agree on version at publish time; mismatch blocks
  publish.
  _Source:_ `dev/release-policy.md` § Version Source Of Truth + § Release
  Gates.

- **REQ-050 — Retry-safe multi-registry completion.** A release is complete
  only after every required artifact target succeeds and is verified. Exact
  immutable bytes already present with the expected identity/digest are a
  no-op; absence permits publish; query uncertainty fails closed. A partial
  publish is never marked complete. Targets are enumerated by
  ADR-0.6.0-tier1-ci-platforms + per-binding publish workflow.
  _Source:_ `dev/release-policy.md` § Manual Fallback + § Release
  Workflow Shape; ADR-0.6.0-tier1-ci-platforms.

- **REQ-051 — `sqlite-vec` availability validated at open.** Engine
  validates the `sqlite-vec` extension is available at `Engine.open`
  whenever the store contains any vector rows; never fails per-query
  under partial extension installs.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` POST 5.
  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-sqlite-vec-acceptance,
  ADR-0.6.0-vector-index-location.

- **REQ-052 — Target-native installed package is the release gate.** Release
  evidence is each affected target's exact public package installed into a
  fresh environment from its declared source and run end-to-end. The evidence
  records identity, version, source, digest, and target provenance.
  _Source:_ memory `feedback_release_verification`;
  `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` Tests §5. _Cross-cite:_
  ADR-0.6.0-tier1-ci-platforms (per-binding smoke spec).

## Public surface (REQ-053..REQ-059)

- **REQ-053 — Governed application runtime SDK surface.** The public
  application runtime SDK surface is **governed, not capped** (amended 0.8.0,
  Slice 25, per `ADR-0.8.0-supersede-five-verb-surface-cap`): a curated,
  parity-locked **allowlist** partitioned into a write/admin/lifecycle core
  (`Engine.open`, `admin.configure`, `write`, `search`, `close`) and an
  additive `read.*` read surface (`read.get`, `read.get_many`,
  `read.collection`, `read.mutations`, … added by demonstrated need). The
  surface is constrained by three permanent rules: **cross-binding parity** (a
  verb appears in every SDK binding or in none), a **recovery-name denylist**
  (`{recover, restore, repair, fix, rebuild}` are never SDK-reachable; `doctor`
  is SDK-absent via allowlist non-membership), and the **typed / no-raw-SQL
  boundary** (typed args + a small fixed filter grammar, never raw SQL or a
  query DSL). Adding a verb is a deliberate, documented event, not silent
  drift. (CLI is a separate surface — see REQ-036, REQ-054.) Supersedes the
  earlier "exactly five verbs, no more" scope cap, which was a development
  scaffolding device.
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.5.7-corrected-scope.md` § 0.6.0 RFC;
  `dev/notes/0.6.0-rewrite-proposal.md` § Public API;
  `ADR-0.8.0-supersede-five-verb-surface-cap` (governed surface).
  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.6.0-prepared-write-shape (write-shape),
  ADR-0.6.0-typed-write-boundary.

- **REQ-054 — Recovery / repair verbs are CLI-only.** `rebuild_projections`,
  `restore_*`, `check_integrity`, `safe_export`, etc. are reachable
  only via the CLI surface, not via the runtime SDK. (Distinct from
  REQ-037 which is the SDK-side unreachability claim; this is the
  CLI-side completeness claim.)
  _Source:_ `dev/notes/0.5.7-corrected-scope.md` D2. _Cross-cite:_
  ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope.

- **REQ-055 — Freshness cursors exposed on read tx + write commit.**
  Read transactions expose a monotonic non-decreasing
  `projection_cursor`; write commits return a monotonic write cursor
  identifying the commit just accepted. Clients reason about staleness
  by polling until `read_projection_cursor >= write_cursor`; the write
  return value is not itself the read-side `projection_cursor`.
  _Source:_ ADR-0.6.0-projection-freshness-sli.

- **REQ-056 — Engine errors as typed, language-idiomatic exceptions.**
  In every binding (Python, TypeScript, CLI) engine errors surface as
  a typed exception hierarchy; clients distinguish error classes
  without string-pattern matching.

- **REQ-057 — Op-store collection kinds are authoritative.** 0.6.0
  operational-state persistence exposes exactly two authoritative collection
  kinds: `append_only_log` and `latest_state`. `append_only_log` preserves
  durable history by appending authoritative rows to
  `operational_mutations`; `latest_state` stores the authoritative current row
  directly in `operational_state` keyed by `(collection_name, record_key)`.
  0.6.0 does not reintroduce a derived `operational_current` table.
  _Source:_ ADR-0.6.0-op-store-same-file.

- **REQ-058 — Op-store collection lifecycle is explicit and narrow.**
  Operational collections are named registry entries with declared metadata
  (`kind`, schema/retention metadata, format version, creation time) and a
  fixed collection kind. 0.6.0 exposes no collection rename, disable,
  soft-retire, or alternate latest-state lifecycle.

  `design/op-store.md`.

- **REQ-059 — Projection failure diagnosis and regeneration are operator
  workflows.** Exhausted projection failures are recorded durably in
  `projection_failures`, and operators can explicitly regenerate projections
  from canonical state through the accepted recovery surface. The workflow name
  "regenerate" in 0.6.0 maps to
  `fathomdb recover --accept-data-loss --rebuild-projections`; it is not a
  separate SDK verb or separate CLI root.

## Security hardening (REQ-060..REQ-066)

Added 2026-05-02 as an HITL amendment to the locked corpus per
`dev/security-review.md` HITL decision. Each REQ closes a 0.6.0 security
finding with a user-visible falsifiable outcome.

- **REQ-060 — Op-store payload validation completes in bounded time.**
  Op-store JSON-Schema payload validation against any registered
  `schema_id` completes in bounded time even when the schema's `pattern`
  / `patternProperties` regex is adversarial. Caller observes
  `SchemaValidationError` (or success), never a wedged writer.
  _Source:_ `dev/security-review.md` SR-002. _Cross-cite:_
  `design/op-store.md` § Write contract; `design/errors.md`
  `SchemaValidationError`.

- **REQ-061 — Op-store schemas reject external `$ref`.** Schema
  registration via `admin.configure` rejects any schema containing a
  non-fragment `$ref` URI (`http://`, `https://`, `file://`, or any
  network-resolvable scheme). Rejection happens at registration time,
  before any payload validation, with a typed error.
  _Source:_ `dev/security-review.md` SR-003. _Cross-cite:_
  `design/op-store.md` schema registration.

- **REQ-062 — Embedder-returned vector dimension validated before vec0
  write.** A wrong-length vector returned by the caller-supplied
  embedder surfaces as `EmbedderDimensionMismatchError` and produces no
  vec0 row write; the writer transaction rolls back cleanly.
  Dimension validation occurs at exactly one boundary, between embedder
  return and vec0 write.
  _Source:_ `dev/security-review.md` SR-004. _Cross-cite:_
  `design/embedder.md`; `design/vector.md`; `design/errors.md`
  `EmbedderDimensionMismatchError`.

- **REQ-063 — FFI panics surface as language-native exceptions.** A
  Rust panic raised inside a Python or TypeScript binding entry point
  surfaces to the caller as a typed binding exception; it never aborts
  the host process and never unwinds across the FFI boundary as
  undefined behavior.
  _Source:_ `dev/security-review.md` SR-006. _Cross-cite:_
  `design/bindings.md`; `interfaces/python.md`;
  `interfaces/typescript.md`.

- **REQ-064 — FFI string inputs reject embedded NUL and unpaired
  surrogates.** Any caller-supplied string (Python `str` /
  TypeScript `string`) reaching a `write` / `search` /
  `admin.configure` argument is rejected with `WriteValidationError`
  if it contains an embedded `\0` byte or an unpaired UTF-16
  surrogate. Rejection happens at the binding layer, before the
  payload reaches the writer.
  _Source:_ `dev/security-review.md` SR-007. _Cross-cite:_
  `interfaces/python.md`; `interfaces/typescript.md`;
  `design/errors.md` `WriteValidationError`.

- **REQ-065 — Error `Display` output omits internal SQL, absolute
  paths, and parser byte offsets.** The `Display` representation of
  every `EngineError` and `EngineOpenError` variant (and their
  language-native binding counterparts) omits raw SQL fragments,
  absolute host filesystem paths, and parser byte offsets. Internal
  diagnostic chains remain available to engine logging.
  _Source:_ `dev/security-review.md` SR-008. _Cross-cite:_
  `design/errors.md` § Foreign-cause sanitization.

- **REQ-066 — Migration failure preserves prior `user_version`.** When
  a schema migration fails mid-way, the SQLite `PRAGMA user_version`
  remains at the prior version after `Engine.open` returns
  `MigrationError`. A subsequent reopen with a corrected migration
  step starts from the prior version, not from a partially-applied
  state.
  _Source:_ `dev/security-review.md` SR-010. _Cross-cite:_
  `design/migrations.md`; `design/engine.md` open-path step 5;
  `design/errors.md` `MigrationError`.

- **REQ-067 — Agentic IR / evidence recall (PLACEHOLDER — target 0.8.1; measure
  - numbers TBD by the IR-eval `IR-1`/`IR-2` initiative).** When the agent needs a
  stored memory to answer or act, the retrieved context contains the evidence
  required — measured on the **IR / agentic-relevance** axis (qrels / fact-level
  gold labels), NOT the ANN-fidelity axis that REQ-011 / AC-075 already gate.
  This is the **product-value** recall requirement; today only the
  system-health fidelity floor is gated, and the IR signal (`eu8_ir_validation.rs`,
  ceiling ≈0.571) is report-only. **This entry is a reserved placeholder:** the
  falsifiable statement, the chosen measure (Evidence/Task Recall@K vs
  alternatives), and every threshold are **TBD** — defined + experiment-grounded
  by IR-1 (with a Claude↔codex consensus step on the measure) and ruled to the
  reserved **AC-077** by IR-2. _Source:_
  `dev/notes/recall-eval-framework-assessment-20260607T174821Z.md`;
  `dev/plans/prompts/0.8.x-IR-1-recall-measure.md`.

- **REQ-068 — CUDA-capable Linux artifacts remain CPU-loadable without CUDA.**
  The supported Linux x86_64 Python and npm artifacts that include CUDA support
  must load and complete CPU operation when the host has no CUDA runtime,
  NVIDIA driver, or NVIDIA device nodes. No packaged ELF member dynamically
  depends on, or archive payload bundles, a CUDA/NVIDIA user-mode library.
  Unset/`auto` resolves to CPU on such a host; explicit `cpu` performs no CUDA
  initialization even on a CUDA host; forced `cuda:N` fails typed and never
  executes CPU work. The contract covers both embedder and reranker CUDA
  features in the shared artifact.
  _Source:_ HITL-approved 0.8.24 corrective release decision (2026-08-31).
  _Cross-cite:_ ADR-0.8.25-driverless-cuda-runtime-linkage;
  `design/0.8.25-driverless-cuda-runtime.md`.

## Source-trace summary

Every REQ above cites either a specific `dev/` source file (preserved
under `docs/archive/0.5.x/` per Phase 1a disposition where applicable),
an accepted ADR, or a memory id. Citations are not exhaustive — they
identify the originating source, not every place an outcome is restated.
For numerical targets, the cited ADR is authoritative.
