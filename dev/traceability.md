# Traceability Matrix

This file proves end-to-end traceability for the 0.6.0 rewrite:

`needs.md` -> `requirements.md` -> `design/*` and `interfaces/*` -> `test-plan.md`.

Rules:

- Every `NEED-*` maps to at least one `REQ-*`.
- Every `REQ-*` maps to at least one `AC-*` and therefore at least one `T-*`
  (per `dev/test-plan.md` ID convention).
- Every planned test exists to satisfy one or more `REQ-*` (and therefore one
  or more `NEED-*`).

This matrix is intentionally coarse-grained: it ties needs to the owning
requirements and the owning design/interface docs, and points to test-plan suite
coverage for execution identity.

### Note on NEED-026

NEED-026 was added 2026-05-11 to give the security-hardening AC cluster
(REQ-060..REQ-066 / AC-064..AC-070) an explicit traceability row. The
underlying user-facing concerns are implicit in NEED-001 (trustworthy
storage), NEED-002 (local-first / no implicit egress), and NEED-021
(corruption detection / safety). NEED-026 is the dedicated trace row for
the 2026-05-02 HITL security amendment; NEED-021 also picks up the
diagnostic-facing REQ-063 / REQ-064 / AC-069 / AC-070 rows because they
overlap with corruption diagnostics.

## Pre-Lock Validation

The coarse matrix is ready for HITL lock review with the following checks
complete:

- Every `NEED-*` row maps to concrete `REQ-*` ids present in
  `dev/requirements.md`.
- Every referenced design/interface file exists and is the owning surface for
  the cited behavior.
- `dev/acceptance.md` carries the authoritative REQ->AC matrix; `dev/test-plan.md`
  defines deterministic `AC-*` -> `T-*` identities and suite/scaffold ownership.

Deep traceability to every explicit `T-*` id and concrete fixture file remains
deferred until the test fixtures and scaffold paths stabilize during
implementation.
