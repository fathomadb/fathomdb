# CLI

Binary: `fathomdb`. Operator-only; the CLI does **not** ship
application-surface verbs like `search`, `get`, or `list`. Use the SDK
for those.

Authoritative spec:
[`dev/interfaces/cli.md`](https://github.com/coreyt/fathomdb/blob/main/dev/interfaces/cli.md);
recovery semantics owned by `dev/design/recovery.md`.

## Roots

- `fathomdb doctor <verb> ...` — read-only or artifact-producing
  diagnostics.
- `fathomdb recover --accept-data-loss <sub-flag> ...` — the only
  lossy / non-bit-preserving root.

## Output

- `--json` is the normative machine-readable contract on every verb.
- `--pretty` is a human-only formatter on verbs that explicitly
  document it.
- `recover --json` emits an NDJSON progress stream plus a final
  summary object. All other verbs emit a single JSON object.
- Doctor wrap shape: `{ "verb": "<verb-name>", ...flattened_report_fields... }`.
- Field names: serde `snake_case`.

| `recompute-mean`  | `fathomdb doctor recompute-mean <db_path>` — re-derive and re-pin the corpus mean, re-quantizing every row in one transaction | see [exit-code classes](#exit-code-classes) |

`check-integrity --full` may emit doctor-only finding codes such as
`E_CORRUPT_INTEGRITY_CHECK`.

### GPU and platform diagnostics

`fathomdb doctor gpu [--json]` reports the existing
`fathomdb.doctor.gpu.v1` record. Its schema is unchanged. On confirmed ARM64
SBSA hardware, automatic policy reports `cuda_incompatible` with
`arm64_sbsa_unsupported` and continues on CPU; forced `cuda:N` exits `65`.
Explicit `cpu` never probes CUDA or the platform subprocess. An indeterminate
`nvidia-smi` platform probe does not make `doctor gpu` fail; it uses the normal
CUDA-provider diagnostic instead.

`fathomdb doctor platform [--json]` is the companion database-free classifier.
Its JSON record is `fathomdb.doctor.platform.v1` with ordered fields
`schema_version`, `platform_class`, `tegra_family`, `sbsa_capable`,
`l4t_release`, and `reason`. `platform_class` is one of `tegra`,
`arm64_sbsa`, `generic_aarch64`, `non_aarch64`, or `unknown`. The classifier
uses filesystem Tier 1 plus an ordered absolute `nvidia-smi` Tier 2 probe; an
unavailable, timed-out, or nonzero Tier 2 result is `unknown` and exits `70`.

For Jetson/Tegra CUDA, 0.8.23 has no published artifact. The exact source-build
procedure is available in `fathomdb doctor gpu --help`; run the final
`python -m pip install <built-wheel>` line printed by the wrapper after it
proves the generated wheel.

### `dump-mutations` — op-store read-back

A read-only operator diagnostic that pages the op-store mutation log
(`operational_mutations`) for one `append_only_log` collection. It is a
diagnostic dump over operator/log data (like `dump-row-counts` / `trace`), **not**
an application query verb — there is no `search` / `get` / `list` surface over
application content. `--limit` bounds the page (default `1000`; the engine clamps
to a ~1M cap); `--after-id` is an exclusive cursor for the next page. An empty,
unknown, or unregistered collection (or an `--after-id` past the end) is a normal
absence and exits `0`.

```bash
fathomdb doctor dump-mutations events --limit 2 --json ./store.sqlite
```

```json
{
  "verb": "dump-mutations",
  "collection": "events",
  "after_id": null,
  "limit": 2,
  "count": 2,
  "rows": [
    { "id": 1, "collection": "events", "record_key": "k0", "op_kind": "append",
      "payload": "{\"n\":0}", "schema_id": null, "write_cursor": 1 },
    { "id": 2, "collection": "events", "record_key": "k1", "op_kind": "append",
      "payload": "{\"n\":1}", "schema_id": null, "write_cursor": 2 }
  ],
  "next_after_id": 2
}
```

Resume the next page with `--after-id 2`. When a page is short (fewer rows than
`--limit`), `next_after_id` is `null` — the log is exhausted at that cursor.

### `orphan-provenance` — per-`source_id` census

Read-only. Reports every provenance bucket in the canonical tables and, load-
bearingly, how many rows are reachable by **no** erasure verb.

```bash
fathomdb doctor orphan-provenance --json ./app.sqlite
```

```json
{
  "verb": "orphan-provenance",
  "sources": [
    { "source_id": "tenant-a", "rows": 3, "governed_rows": 0, "reserved": false },
    { "source_id": "tenant-b", "rows": 2, "governed_rows": 1, "reserved": false },
    { "source_id": "_legacy:pre-0.8.20", "rows": 9, "governed_rows": 0, "reserved": true }
  ],
  "total_rows": 14,
  "unerasable_rows": 0
}
```

`unerasable_rows` counts canonical rows carrying **neither** a `source_id` nor a
`logical_id`. `purge` keys on `logical_id` and `erase_source` keys on
`source_id`, so such a row can never be deleted on request. It exits `65`
(`DOCTOR_FOUND_ISSUES`) when that count is non-zero, `0` otherwise.

`reserved: true` marks the engine's `_`-prefixed namespace. Those buckets are
erasable only through `fathomdb recover --excise-source`, never through the SDK
`erase_source` verb. They are reported, but they are **not** an issue.

See [Erasure](../operations/erasure.md) for the full erasure boundary.

## Recover root

```text
fathomdb recover --accept-data-loss
  [--truncate-wal]
  [--rebuild-vec0]
  [--rebuild-projections]
  [--excise-source <id>]
  [--excise-collection <name> --excise-record-key <key>]
  [--json]
  <db_path>
```

Exit codes: `0` / `64` / `70` / `71`.

`--accept-data-loss` is declared on the `recover` parser only;
`doctor` verbs reject it as unknown.

`--rebuild-projections` is the canonical regenerate workflow for failed
or stale projections. There is no separate `fathomdb regenerate`
command.

`--excise-collection` and `--excise-record-key` are required together;
they erase every append-only-log version of one op-store record key
plus its latest-state row.

### `--excise-source` vs the SDK erasure verbs

Since 0.8.20 the SDK ships its own erasure verbs, so the CLI is no
longer the only route:

| Need | Use |
| ---- | --- |
| erase one **governed** node by `logical_id` | SDK `purge` |
| erase every row from one **provenance** | SDK `erase_source` |
| erase inside the engine's reserved `_`-prefixed namespace | `fathomdb recover --excise-source` (CLI only) |
| erase one op-store record key | `fathomdb recover --excise-collection … --excise-record-key …` (CLI only) |

```bash
fathomdb recover --accept-data-loss --excise-source <id> --json ./app.sqlite
```

See [Erasure](../operations/erasure.md) for the full boundary — what
erasure reaches and what it does not.

## Exit-code classes

| Code | Meaning                                                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | successful completion; no findings requiring non-zero exit           |
| `64` | recovery completed because lossy action was explicitly accepted      |
| `65` | doctor / verification surface found actionable non-clean state       |
| `66` | export / materialization failure on an artifact-producing doctor verb|
| `70` | unrecoverable command failure                                        |
| `71` | lock-held or equivalent precondition-blocked outcome                 |

The full engine-error → exit-code mapping is in the locked spec.

## Logical-id verbs

Logical-id lifecycle landed as **SDK** verbs, not CLI verbs:
`transition` (soft-delete / undelete / promote) and `purge`
(irreversible hard-erase, deleted-first). There is no
`fathomdb purge-logical-id` command, and **no restore verb of any
kind** — a purge is not reversible.

See [Python API](python-api.md) / [TypeScript API](typescript-api.md).
