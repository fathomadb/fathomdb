# TypeScript API

Package: `fathomdb`. Authoritative spec:
[`dev/interfaces/typescript.md`](https://github.com/coreyt/fathomdb/blob/main/dev/interfaces/typescript.md).

> **Release state.** 0.8.21 is the current published release. This reference
> also documents the local 0.8.22 candidate; its candidate-only APIs are not
> available from a registry until the held release gates complete.

**TS SDK parity caveat.** The TS surface covers the same governed command set
and the same error taxonomy as Python, but Python remains the more heavily
exercised binding. Prefer Python for production pilots. See
[SDK parity](../positions/sdk-parity.md).

All runtime operations are Promise-returning. The TS↔Python parity
matrix is in [`dev/notes/12-TX-parity-matrix.md`](https://github.com/coreyt/fathomdb/blob/main/dev/notes/12-TX-parity-matrix.md).

## `Engine`

### `Engine.open(path, options?) -> Promise<Engine>`

Open or create a FathomDB database at `path`.

- `path` (`string`).
- `options` (`EngineOpenOptions`):
  - `engineConfig` (`EngineConfig`) — engine knobs in camelCase.
    See [config](config.md).

Rejects with a `FathomDbError` subclass on failure:
`DatabaseLockedError`, `CorruptionError`,
`IncompatibleSchemaVersionError`, `MigrationError`,
`EmbedderIdentityMismatchError`, `EmbedderDimensionMismatchError`.
See [errors](errors.md).

The structured open report is available after open via
`engine.openReport()` (below).

### `engine.openReport() -> OpenReport`

The structured open report defined in `dev/design/engine.md`:
`migrationVersionReached`, embedder identity confirmation, open-stage
data, `denseDisabled` / `denseDisabledReason`, and the embedder
telemetry fields (`embedderDownloadMs`, `embedderEvents`,
`embedderMeanCenteringRequired`, `embedderMeanVecPinned`).

### `engine.write(batch?) -> Promise<WriteReceipt>`

Enqueue a batch of canonical rows.

- `batch` (`unknown[]`) — caller-shaped canonical rows. Defaults to `[]`
  (a valid, item-less batch).

Every **node** item accepts these keys:

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| `kind` | `string` | **yes** | record kind |
| `body` | `string` | **yes** | record body |
| `sourceId` / `source_id` | `string` | **yes** | provenance — see below |
| `logicalId` | `string` | no | governed cross-re-ingestion identity |
| `state` | `string` | no | create-time existence state: `"active"` (default) or `"pending"` |
| `reason` | `string` | no | advisory cause for `state`; stored verbatim, never interpreted |
| `validFrom` / `valid_from` | `number` | no | world-time window, INCLUSIVE lower bound, epoch **seconds** UTC |
| `validUntil` / `valid_until` | `number` | no | world-time window, EXCLUSIVE upper bound, epoch **seconds** UTC |

An **edge** item takes `kind`, `from`, `to`, the same mandatory
`sourceId`, an optional `logicalId`, and the temporal pair
`tValid` / `tInvalid` (`number | null`, epoch **seconds** UTC; `null`
means "still valid"). Both camelCase and snake_case spellings are
accepted for every dual-spelled key (camelCase is consulted first).

**`sourceId` is MANDATORY (0.8.20).** `eraseSource` addresses rows *by*
`sourceId`, so a row written without one is reachable by no erasure
call. A missing, empty, whitespace-only or **reserved** (`_`-prefixed)
value rejects with `WriteValidationError`. Treat it as a public
identifier: use an opaque document or tenant id, never personal data —
see [Erasure](../operations/erasure.md).

**`logicalId`** — supplying it makes the write a transaction-time
**supersession** of the prior active version of that `logicalId` (the
prior version is tombstoned and the new one becomes active —
invalidate-not-delete). Active-row identity is scoped to `logicalId`
alone, so re-ingesting the same `logicalId` with a different `kind`
supersedes (it does not create a second active row). Omitting it is a
plain insert with a NULL `logicalId` that never collides with other
NULLs.

**Validity window** — half-open `[validFrom, validUntil)`. Omitting both
binds NULL/NULL (unbounded, the pre-0.8.20 default). Both bounds present
with `validFrom >= validUntil` is unsatisfiable and rejects with
`WriteValidationError`; validation runs before any insert, so the whole
batch is rejected. A one-sided window is never refused. A non-integral
bound rejects with `WriteValidationError` and is never truncated.

```ts
const receipt = await engine.write([
  { kind: "note", body: "hello", sourceId: "doc-42" },
  { kind: "note", body: "governed", sourceId: "doc-42", logicalId: "note:hello" },
  { kind: "mentions", from: "note:hello", to: "acme", sourceId: "doc-42",
    tValid: 1_546_300_800, tInvalid: null },
]);
```

- Returns: `WriteReceipt { cursor, rowCursors, danglingEdgeEndpoints }` —
  `cursor` is the batch high-water `write_cursor`; `rowCursors` are the
  per-row `write_cursor`s, 1:1 with the input batch order;
  `danglingEdgeEndpoints` (G8) counts the edge endpoints in this batch
  pointing at a non-existent or superseded node — see
  [`WriteReceipt`](#writereceipt).

### `engine.search(query, filter?, rerankDepth?, useGraphArm?, alpha?, poolN?, explain?, options?) -> Promise<SearchResult>`

Run hybrid retrieval, ranked by **G9 RRF fusion**, with optional CPU
cross-encoder reranking (0.8.1 R1) and optional graph-BFS third arm (0.8.1 R3).

- `query` (`string`).
- `filter` ([`SearchFilter`](#searchfilter), optional) — closed metadata filter;
  omitted (or all-`undefined`) is the unfiltered path.
- `rerankDepth` (`number`, optional, default `undefined`/`0`) — 0.8.1 R1 opt-in.
  `0` or omitted uses the identity / soft-fallback path: byte-identical to the
  pre-0.8.1 fused order. `N > 0` applies a CPU cross-encoder (TinyBERT-L-2,
  ≈4 MB, p50 ≈ 1.5 ms/pair) over the top-N fused hits with score-blend
  (α=0.3 × CE + 0.7 × RRF-norm). Must be a non-negative integer; negative
  values throw `RangeError`, non-integer values throw `TypeError`. In the
  default build (no `default-reranker` feature), depth > 0 returns the identity
  order (model absent → soft-fallback).
- `useGraphArm` (`boolean`, optional, default `undefined`/`false`) — 0.8.1 R3
  opt-in. When `true`, seeds a BFS over temporal fact-edges from the top-10 fused
  hits (depth ≤ 3, cap 50). Edges with `tInvalid` in the past are excluded.
  Newly-reachable nodes are fused as a third RRF arm (`RRF_WEIGHT_GRAPH = 1.0`).
  Omitted or `false` produces byte-identical results to the pre-R3 two-arm
  pipeline. Non-boolean values throw `TypeError`.
- `alpha` (`number`, optional, default `undefined`/`0.3`) — 0.8.5 (EXP-0)
  CE-blend weight, clamped to `[0, 1]` in the engine. Omitted ⇒ `0.3`, the
  **C6 factoid-guard** default. **`alpha: 1.0` is opt-in for the agentic-answer
  / memory path** (the measured Mem0-parity config); the `0.3` default protects
  naive factoid lookups. Non-finite values throw `RangeError`. Effective only
  when `rerankDepth > 0` and the CE model is loaded.
- `poolN` (`number`, optional, default `undefined`/`rerankDepth`) — 0.8.5 (EXP-0)
  reranked-pool size, clamped to the hit count. Omitted ⇒ `rerankDepth`. Note
  `rerankDepth === 0` is still the identity gate, so `rerankDepth: 0, poolN: 10`
  does **not** rerank. Must be a non-negative integer (`RangeError` otherwise).
- `options.limit` (`number`, default `10`) — maximum ranked hits returned. It
  must be an integer in `1..=100`; out-of-range values reject with
  `InvalidArgumentError`, never a silent clamp. `options` also accepts the
  existing `ReadView` fields.
- Resolves to a `SearchResult` whose `results` is a `SearchHit[]`; each
  [`SearchHit`](#searchhit) carries the matched record's `id`, `kind`, `body`,
  the **RRF-fused** `score`, the `branch` that produced it (`"graph_arm"`
  for nodes surfaced only via graph traversal), and `ceScore` (the per-candidate
  CE score for in-pool reranked hits, `null` otherwise).

> **Ranking is RRF (behavior-compat event).** Results are ordered by Reciprocal
> Rank Fusion (`Σ 1/(60 + rank)`) of the vector and text branches — the
> deliberate, documented 0.8.0 ranking change; pre-0.8.0 union-dedup ordering is
> not retained. See [hybrid search guide](../guides/hybrid-search-filtering.md).

### `engine.searchTextOnly(query, options?): Promise<SearchResult>`

Run direct FTS retrieval without embedding, vector retrieval, CE reranking, or
graph expansion. Matching node- and edge-body candidates are deterministically
body-deduplicated and ranked before `options.limit` is applied. The node
candidate input is fixed at 100, so for the same immutable selection, query,
and effective validity time, a smaller accepted limit returns the ordered prefix
of a larger one. Compare `validAsOf` calls only at the same explicit instant;
an omitted `validAsOf` resolves per call. This guarantee does not extend to
hybrid `engine.search`.

### `engine.searchProjectedText(query, name, filter?, options?): Promise<SearchResult>`

Search exactly one declared `SEARCHABLE` property-FTS projection. The final
`SearchOptions` accepts `limit` with the same default and validation as
`engine.search`; metadata and validity filters are applied before retained hits
consume that result budget.

### `engine.embed(text) -> Promise<number[]>`

Embed `text` with the engine's pinned default embedder
(`fathomdb-bge-small-en-v1.5`) and return the raw vector. Read-path
primitive for callers that need vectors under the engine's **own**
embedder identity (e.g. coverage-index clustering) rather than a
parallel, possibly-divergent embedder. Rejects with
`EmbedderNotConfiguredError` if the engine was opened without an
embedder (`useDefaultEmbedder: false`). Mirror of the Python
`engine.embed(text)` (0.8.6 Slice 10 brought it to Py↔TS parity).

### `engine.transition(logicalId, toState, reason?) -> Promise<void>`

**0.8.19.** Move a **governed** node between existence states, per the
engine-enforced legal-transition table. `toState` is a
`LifecycleState` (`"pending" | "active" | "deleted" | "purged"`):

| From | To | Effect |
| ---- | -- | ------ |
| `pending` | `active` | promote (clears `reason`) |
| `pending` | `deleted` | **rejected** |
| `active` | `deleted` | soft-delete (sets `reason`) |
| `deleted` | `active` | undelete (clears `reason`) |

`reason` is advisory and never interpreted by the engine. Keys on the
bare `logicalId` — the `logical` (`l:`) id space only; a `content`
(`h:`) or `passage` (`p:`) id throws `NotLifecycleAddressableError`. An
illegal move throws `IllegalTransitionError` carrying `fromState`,
`toState` and `legal`.

### `engine.purge(logicalId: string) -> Promise<void>`

**0.8.19.** Irreversibly hard-erase a governed node across every
row-owned target — all versions, its FTS/vector shadows, and its
touching edges (cascade-removed).

**Deleted-first:** legal only from `"deleted"`, otherwise
`IllegalTransitionError`. **Idempotent:** purging an absent or
already-purged id is a no-op success. A non-`l:` id throws
`NotLifecycleAddressableError`.

`purge` addresses one **governed** node. For anonymous content — rows
written with no `logicalId` — use `eraseSource` below.

### `engine.eraseSource(sourceId: string) -> Promise<EraseReport>`

**0.8.20.** Erase every canonical row carrying `sourceId`, together with its
row-owned projections (FTS5, `vec0`, `search_index_v2`), then finish the erasure
at rest — redact the erased ids from the telemetry sink and truncate the WAL.

The **companion to `purge`, not a duplicate of it.** `purge` addresses a
*governed* node by `logicalId`; `eraseSource` addresses *anonymous* content —
rows written with no `logicalId`, which `purge` cannot reach at all. Together
they make every canonical row erasable from the SDK alone, with no CLI on
`PATH`.

Idempotent: erasing an absent or already-erased source is a zero-count success,
so an interrupted erasure obligation can be retried without a pre-check.

Rejects with `WriteValidationError` for an empty, whitespace-only, or
**reserved** (`_`-prefixed) `sourceId`. The engine's reserved namespace
(`_engine:*` substrate and the `_legacy:pre-0.8.20` migration cohort) is
reachable only through `fathomdb recover --excise-source`. Rejects with
`ErasureIncompleteError` (carrying `stage` and `detail`) rather than reporting
success if the erasure could not be completed at rest.

Resolves to an `EraseReport` with `sourceRef`, `nodesExcised`, `edgesExcised`,
and `projectionsInvalidated`. Mirror of the Python
`engine.erase_source(source_id)` (Py↔TS parity).

See [Erasure](../operations/erasure.md) for what this does and does **not**
guarantee, and for the non-PII `sourceId` rule.

### `engine.close() -> Promise<void>`

Release SQLite handles, join the writer thread, drain the scheduler.
Idempotent.

### `engine.drain(timeoutMs) -> Promise<void>`

Block until in-flight writes drain or `timeoutMs` elapses. Argument
unit is **milliseconds** (Python counterpart uses seconds).

### `engine.counters() -> CounterSnapshot`

Synchronous snapshot. See [`CounterSnapshot`](#countersnapshot).

### `engine.setProfiling(enabled: boolean) -> void`

Toggle per-operation profiling.

### `engine.setSlowThresholdMs(value: number) -> void`

Set the slow-query threshold for profiling event emission.

### `engine.attachSubscriber(callback, options?) -> void`

Bind engine events to a callback. `callback: (event:
SubscriberEvent) => void` receives the stable `fathomdb` payload
described in `dev/design/bindings.md`. `options.heartbeatIntervalMs`
is optional.

### Properties

- `engine.config` (`EngineConfig`) — resolved config.

## `admin.configure`

```ts
import { admin } from "fathomdb";

const receipt = await admin.configure(engine, { name: "my-schema", body: schemaJson });
```

`admin.configure(engine: Engine, options: AdminConfigureOptions):
Promise<WriteReceipt>` where `AdminConfigureOptions = { name:
string; body: string }`.

## `read.*` — governed read verbs (including 0.8.22 Slice 22)

```ts
import { read } from "fathomdb";
```

The retrieval verbs below use the engine's **ReaderWorkerPool DEFERRED-tx
snapshot path**, preserving single-writer isolation. `read.projections` and
`read.projectionStatus` are different: they are pure introspection queries
through the ordinarily opened engine and may briefly take its connection lock.
They do not configure, write, or schedule work, but do not promise a separately
opened read-only SQLite mode. Verb names are camelCase in TS but the governed
allowlist names stay dotted snake_case (`read.get_many`).

### `read.get(engine, logicalId: string): Promise<NodeRecord | null>`

Active-only point lookup by `logicalId` (active = `superseded_at IS NULL`). A
superseded version is never returned. A missing or superseded id resolves to
`null` — a **normal absence, not a thrown error**.

### `read.getMany(engine, logicalIds: string[]): Promise<(NodeRecord | null)[]>`

Batched point lookup. Returns one slot per requested id, **in request order**;
a missing/superseded id is `null` in its slot (partial, never all-or-nothing).
`read.get` delegates to `read.getMany`.

### `read.collection(engine, collection, options): Promise<OpStoreRow[]>`

Paginated op-store read-back over `operational_mutations` for `collection`,
**`ORDER BY id`**, where `options: ReadCollectionOptions = { afterId?: number;
limit: number }`. `limit` is **mandatory** (the engine clamps it to a ~1M cap,
so no call yields an unbounded read); `afterId` is the exclusive cursor.

### `read.mutations(engine, collection, options): Promise<OpStoreRow[]>`

Mutation-log-oriented alias surface over the **same** op-store read-back as
`read.collection` (identical args + semantics).

### `read.list(engine, kind, predicates?, limit?): Promise<NodeRecord[]>`

*(G4 / Slice 35)* List **active** `canonical_nodes` of the given `kind`
(`superseded_at IS NULL`), optionally filtered by a `Predicate[]` array
(AND-combined), up to `limit` rows (default 100).

```ts
interface Predicate {
  type: "eq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte";
  path: string;     // must be from the allowlist: $.status, $.priority, $.tags, $.kind, $.created_at
  value: string | number | boolean;
}
```

`path` must be from the engine allowlist: `$.status`, `$.priority`,
`$.tags`, `$.kind`, `$.created_at`. A non-allowlisted path throws
`InvalidFilterError` (never a panic). Values are **always bound as
parameterized SQL** — never interpolated (injection-safe per ADR D-F4).
An empty or omitted `predicates` is the unfiltered path.

```ts
import { Engine, read } from "fathomdb";
import { InvalidFilterError } from "fathomdb";

const engine = await Engine.open("my.db");
// All active task nodes:
const tasks = await read.list(engine, "task");
// Filtered: open tasks with priority > 5:
const openHigh = await read.list(engine, "task", [
  { type: "eq",  path: "$.status",   value: "open" },
  { type: "gt",  path: "$.priority", value: 5 },
]);
```

### Projection registry and derived readiness

`engine.configureProjections(specs, drop?)` declares the durable projection
registry. It is idempotent: omitting a live declaration does not delete it,
while an explicit destructive change requires its name in `drop`.
`read.projections(engine): Promise<ProjectionSpec[]>` returns those durable
declarations in name order.

For an effective vector declaration, the returned
`ProjectionSpec.vectorDenseReadiness: DenseReadiness | null` is engine-set
read metadata, never part of configuration. Supplying a valid readiness value
with `vector: true` to `configureProjections` is accepted but inert, so a result
from `read.projections` can be configured again as a no-op; an invalid spelling
or a readiness with `vector: false` is rejected. With no usable dense runtime
(including an equivalence refusal), the engine reports `"unavailable"`.
With a usable runtime it reports `"embedding"` while eligible shared work is
outstanding; after `await engine.drain(...)` completes and no further work is
issued, it reports `"ready"`. `DenseReadiness` is exactly `"unavailable" |
"embedding" | "ready"`.

### `read.projectionStatus(engine): Promise<ProjectionRuntimeStatus>`

Read current projection-runtime status without configuring projections or
changing the registry, storage, scheduler, or work queue. It is a status facade,
not a decorated `ProjectionSpec` and not a per-projection completion report.
It may briefly take the ordinarily opened engine connection lock; it is not a
ReaderWorkerPool request and does not promise a separate read-only SQLite
connection.

```ts
interface ProjectionRuntimeStatus {
  runtimeEmbedderAvailable: boolean;
  runtimeUnavailabilityReason:
    | "none"
    | "no_runtime"
    | "vector_equivalence_disabled";
  projections: ProjectionRuntimeStatusEntry[];
  vectorUnsupportedKinds: string[];
}
interface ProjectionRuntimeStatusEntry {
  name: string;
  denseReadiness: "not_declared" | "unavailable" | "embedding" | "ready";
}
```

`"none"` is returned exactly when `runtimeEmbedderAvailable` is true. Entries
are sorted by name. `"not_declared"` means the declaration has no effective
vector arm (it needs both `searchable` and a vector sub-object), so a legacy
non-searchable vector sub-object remains `"not_declared"`. The other readiness
values are corpus-wide shared-pipeline facts and can repeat across effective
vector declarations. `vectorUnsupportedKinds` is sorted and deduplicated; it is
`[]` when no effective vector arm exists.

## Data shapes

### `WriteReceipt`

```ts
interface WriteReceipt {
  cursor: number; // batch high-water write_cursor
  rowCursors: number[]; // G0 — per-row write_cursor, 1:1 with the batch
  danglingEdgeEndpoints: number; // G8 — edge endpoints pointing at no active node
}
```

`rowCursors` is the `write_cursor`-as-row-id identity carrier (G0 /
Slice 15): for an N-row batch it is `[cursor - N + 1, …, cursor]`.

`danglingEdgeEndpoints` (G8 / Slice 20) counts how many edge endpoints
in the batch point at a node that has **no active version** — either
never written, or superseded (an active node = `superseded_at IS NULL`
carrying that `logicalId`). `from`/`to` are probed independently, so one
edge contributes 0, 1, or 2. It is **informational only**: the batch
always commits (flag-and-count; the write never rejects on a dangling
endpoint). Because endpoints match on `logicalId`, an edge pointing at a
legacy / own-identity node (NULL `logicalId`) counts as dangling — only
`logicalId`-keyed nodes are valid endpoints. `0` when the batch committed
no active edges.

### `NodeRecord`

```ts
interface NodeRecord {
  logicalId: string;
  kind: string;
  body: string;
  writeCursor: number; // engine-internal positional cursor — NOT SearchHit.id
}
```

Returned by `read.get` / `read.getMany` for an **active** canonical node
(`superseded_at IS NULL`). Mirrors the Python `NodeRecord`.

`logicalId` is the caller-facing identity here; `writeCursor` is the engine's
positional book-keeping value, reassigned on re-projection and **not** the same
carrier as [`SearchHit.id`](#searchhit) (which is a typed `IdSpace`).

### `OpStoreRow`

```ts
interface OpStoreRow {
  id: number; // operational_mutations PK + the afterId cursor key
  collection: string;
  recordKey: string;
  opKind: string; // always "append"
  payload: string; // the stored payload_json
  schemaId: string | null;
  writeCursor: number;
}
```

Returned by `read.collection` / `read.mutations`. Mirrors the Python `OpStoreRow`.

### `SearchResult`

```ts
interface SearchResult {
  projectionCursor: number;
  softFallback: SoftFallback | null;
  results: SearchHit[];
}
```

### `SearchHit`

```ts
interface IdSpace {
  space: string; // "logical" | "content" | "passage"
  value: string; // the BARE id (id-space prefix stripped)
}

interface SearchHit {
  id: IdSpace; // typed, non-null, id-space-total hit identity
  kind: string;
  body: string;
  score: number; // G9 RRF-fused relevance (Σ 1/(60+rank)); higher = better
  branch: SoftFallbackBranch; // "vector" | "text" | "text_edge" | "graph_arm"
  sourceId: string | null; // provenance (`eraseSource` arg); set on EVERY hit (TC-31)
  ceScore: number | null; // 0.8.5 CE score (sigmoid logit) for in-pool reranked hits
}
```

> **BREAKING since 0.8.9.** `SearchHit.id` was a `number` row cursor. It is now
> the typed `IdSpace` above — the **permanent** caller-facing identity, not an
> interim carrier. `space` is `"logical"` for governed rows (prefix `l:`),
> `"content"` for doc-seeded rows (`h:`), `"passage"` for synthetic passages
> (`p:`); `value` is the bare id with that prefix stripped, and
> `` `${prefix}${value}` `` reproduces the pre-0.8.19 `stableId` byte-for-byte.
> It is stable across sessions and re-ingest, and never participates in ranking.
> The engine's positional `write_cursor` is internal book-keeping and is **not
> surfaced by the bindings**. Only `logical`-space ids are lifecycle-addressable
> by `transition` / `purge`.

`score` is the **G9 RRF-fused** relevance (higher = more relevant), optionally
recency-reweighted. Raw `vec_distance_l2` (vector) and `bm25()` (text) are fused
on **rank**, never compared raw (they are not comparable). `branch` tags which
branch produced the representative hit (vector-first when both surface a body).
`ceScore` (0.8.5 / EXP-0) is the per-candidate cross-encoder score
(`sigmoid(ce_logit)`) for hits inside the reranked pool, `null` otherwise.

`sourceId` carries the hit's source-document provenance — the identifier
`engine.eraseSource` consumes. **TC-31 (0.8.20): it is populated on
every hit path**, not just the graph arm, so a caller can always resolve a hit
back to the document it came from. Node hits (text/vector) carry the node's own
`sourceId`; edge hits (edge-FTS, vector edge-fact) carry the edge's own;
graph-arm hits carry the traversed edge's. It is `null` only when the stored row
genuinely has NULL provenance — written before 0.8.20, or a governed row spared
by the step-21 backfill. `sourceId` never participates in ranking.

### `SearchFilter`

```ts
interface SearchFilter {
  sourceType?: string;
  kind?: string;
  createdAfter?: number; // created_at >= bound (unix seconds)
  status?: string;
  attributes?: [string, string][];
}
```

G10 — a **closed** metadata filter (not an open DSL) for `engine.search`. Each
present field constrains the vector branch in a single phase-1 KNN statement and
constrains the text branch by the same metadata; omitted/all-`undefined` is the
unfiltered path (byte-identical to the pre-filter query). `status` filters the
vec0 `status` column, which ships an **empty-string sentinel only** (no real
population source yet — vec0 TEXT metadata is not NULL-able), so a
`status: "open"`-style filter prunes every row until a population slice lands.
`attributes` is ordered AND equality over declared `filterable` projections;
its values are canonical text, so projected string `"1"` and number `1` both
match `"1"`.

### `SoftFallback`

```ts
interface SoftFallback {
  branch: SoftFallbackBranch; // "vector" | "text" | "text_edge" | "graph_arm"
}
```

### `CounterSnapshot`

```ts
interface CounterSnapshot {
  queries: number;
  writes: number;
  writeRows: number;
  adminOps: number;
  cacheHit: number;
  cacheMiss: number;
}
```

## `graph.*` — graph traversal (Slice 20 / G5 + G6)

```ts
import { graph } from "fathomdb";
```

The `graph.*` namespace exposes bounded BFS traversal and hybrid
search-plus-expansion. Its reads ride the same **ReaderWorkerPool DEFERRED-tx
snapshot path** as the retrieval verbs in `read.*`; projection introspection
uses the ordinarily opened engine connection instead.

### `graph.neighbors(engine, logicalId, depth, direction?): Promise<NodeRecord[]>`

G5 — bounded BFS from `logicalId` over `canonical_edges`.

- `logicalId` (`string`) — the root node's stable identity.
- `depth` (`number`) — hop limit; **must be 1, 2, or 3**.
  Depth > 3 raises `InvalidArgumentError`.
- `direction` (`"outgoing" | "incoming" | "both"`, default `"both"`) — edge
  direction to follow.

Returns up to **50** `NodeRecord`s reachable within `depth` hops
(root excluded). Edges with `t_invalid` in the past are silently skipped
(valid-time filter). Returns `[]` when the root has no reachable neighbors.

### `graph.searchExpand(engine, query, depth, filter?, options?): Promise<SearchExpandResult>`

G6 — FTS/vector search (G1) followed by bounded BFS expansion.

- `query` (`string`) — free-text or embedding query.
- `depth` (`number`) — BFS hop limit; 0 skips expansion. Depth > 3 raises
  `InvalidArgumentError`.
- `filter` (`SearchFilter | undefined`) — optional metadata filter (same as
  `engine.search`).
- `options.searchLimit` (`number`, default `10`) — maximum initial ranked
  `searchHits`, in `1..=100`; it does not change the 50-per-root expansion cap.

Returns a `SearchExpandResult`. Nodes appearing in both the search hit set and
the traversal reach appear **only** in `searchHits` (deduplication: search score
takes priority).

### `ExpandedNode`

```ts
interface ExpandedNode {
  node: NodeRecord; // the reachable node
  hopCount: number; // BFS distance from the nearest search-hit root
}
```

### `SearchExpandResult`

```ts
interface SearchExpandResult {
  searchHits: SearchHit[];     // original RRF-scored search results
  expanded: ExpandedNode[];    // nodes reachable by traversal, not in searchHits
  allLogicalIds: string[];     // deduplicated union of both sets
}
```

## Errors

`fathomdb` exports `FathomDbError` (the catch-all base) plus **27**
concrete classes below it. See [errors reference](errors.md).

The lifecycle / erasure verbs reject with `IllegalTransitionError`,
`NotLifecycleAddressableError`, `ErasureIncompleteError` and
`WriteValidationError`; `configureProjections` rejects with
`ProjectionDestructiveError` and `WriteValidationError`.

Panics in the Rust runtime surface as `FathomDbPanicError` (not a
`FathomDbError` subclass — panic carriers are deliberately outside
the catch-all root).

## Embedder device (GPU)

There is **no TypeScript API** for selecting the embedder device — it is chosen
by a build-time `embed-cuda` feature plus the `FATHOMDB_EMBED_DEVICE`
environment variable (`auto` default · `cpu` · `cuda:N`), resolved when the
engine opens. `auto` records a typed CPU result when CUDA is unavailable;
forced `cuda:N` fails rather than falling back. See
[Default Embedder → GPU acceleration](../embedder.md#gpu-acceleration-opt-in).
