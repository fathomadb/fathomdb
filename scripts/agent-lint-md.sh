# this gate, saw green, and never knew it hadn't actually run. A gate that cannot run

# ACTIVE plan DOES cite must actually occur in the file it names. That second
# half is the load-bearing one: swapping an unverified number for an unverified
# symbol would launder the same bad pointer. Pure bash/perl, no external binary,

# `_` loss, word-joins that change tokenization). markdownlint-cli2 (AST/token-aware) above is
# the sole structural formatter; it does not have this failure mode. Neutrality of any future
# bulk markdown reformat is verified out-of-band by dev/tools/md-neutrality-guard (markdown-it-py

# the tool implicated in the TC-37 incident (that was markdownlint-cli2 missing 9 real
# structural errors). Hard-failing here would break every worktree that has not run the
# full `scripts/bootstrap.sh` (which `cargo install`s lychee) for a check whose own online/
# offline modality already signals partial, best-effort coverage. Revisit if a lychee-only
# vacuous-green incident is ever observed.
