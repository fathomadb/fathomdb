# Aggregate security-fixture gate. Runs the AC-036, AC-037, AC-038,
# AC-050a, and AC-050c gates that live under scripts/security/.
#
# Exit semantics:
#   0  — every gate green (downgrades, if any, are informational).
#   1  — at least one gate found a real violation (always fatal).
#   2  — tooling blocker (e.g. strace missing or ptrace denied for AC-036);
#        gates that BLOCKER do not fail the overall script unless
#        STRICT=1 is set.
#
# Per-gate exit codes and the STRICT policy live in the shared classifier
# scripts/security/lib-gate-policy.sh (gate_outcome / battery_exit_code), so
# the aggregation can't drift from its demonstrate-the-catch test.
#
# DOWNGRADE (gate rc=3): a gate's authoritative layer is *environmentally*
# unavailable on this host AND a cheaper proof already ran. The only case is
# AC-037's live netns layer, which needs unprivileged userns — blocked on
# ubuntu-latest/24.04 by AppArmor. It is honored as a non-fatal downgrade ONLY
# when the caller opts in for that gate via AC037_LIVE_OPTIONAL=1 (the verify
# job does; the authoritative ubuntu-22.04 `security` CI job does NOT, so a
# userns regression there still hard-fails). Without opt-in, rc=3 is a BLOCKER.
#
# Wiring: scripts/agent-verify.sh invokes this with STRICT=1 (and
# AC037_LIVE_OPTIONAL=1), so a real blocker fails the agent loop on hosts where
# bootstrap.sh has run. Local dev hosts need both strace (bootstrap installs it
# on Debian) and a ptrace-capable executor for AC-036; a sandbox denial is a
# blocker, so rerun unconfined rather than disabling the gate.
