usage() {
  cat >&2 <<'USAGE'
Usage: agent-test.sh [--tier=fast|heavy|all] [--exclude-suite=LABEL ...]

  --tier=fast|heavy|all  Run the requested mechanically-total suite tier.
                         Defaults to all, which runs every registered suite.

  --exclude-suite=LABEL   Exclude the suite registered under LABEL from this
                          run. Repeatable. A demonstration/debugging flag
                          only, NEVER read from an environment variable and
                          NEVER a default — every ordinary run executes
                          every registered suite.

No positional arguments are accepted.

# silent drift: the repo-root LICENSE said MIT, all four publishable manifests
# said Apache-2.0, and NO artifact carried a license file at all — measured with
# `cargo package --list` and `npm pack --dry-run`. crates.io versions are

#
# ⚠ HISTORICAL NOTE — why this entry sits here, not at the end of the
# `scripts/` block. Before 0.8.20 R-20-HARNESS, this file ran under
# `set -euo pipefail` with BARE `run_capped` calls and aborted at the FIRST
# failing suite. `test-check-governed-surface-pin` (below) FAILS on the tree
# as of 0.8.20 Slice 39 — its pin's `git_blob_sha1` provenance claim is
# stale — so everything registered after it was UNREACHABLE and would have
# been a vacuous pass; this entry had to sit ahead of that abort point to
# ever run at all.
#
# That abort is GONE: every suite now runs through `run_suite`
# (scripts/lib/agent-suite-run.sh), which records each outcome and always
# returns 0, so `set -e` can no longer stop the run partway through — a
# failing test-check-governed-surface-pin no longer hides anything
# downstream (test-agent-test-collect-all, right above, proves this: it is
# registered after several suites and asserts it actually ran). Registration
# order is therefore now about REPORT READABILITY (grouping related suites,
# reading top-to-bottom in the summary), not REACHABILITY. This entry is
# left in its historical position rather than moved, since moving it is not
# required by anything and the note above records why it was here.

#      under the workspace default feature set (`default = []`);
#   2. file-level `#![cfg(feature = "default-embedder")]` — compiles to zero
#      tests even when `operator` IS on (e.g. the engine's operator suite);
#   3. `#[ignore]` on the test itself — holds no matter which features are
#      selected, so `--all-features` still would not run the body.
# Verify by inspection only (`-- --list --ignored`), never by running it.
