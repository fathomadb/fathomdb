# ShellCheck — the shell linter. Pinned for the same reason actionlint and ruff

# silently redefines what "green" means.
#
# The installer itself lives in scripts/install-shellcheck.sh — ONE file, so
# that the 0.8.21 Slice 35 `shell-lint` CI job can install the exact same pinned
# linter WITHOUT paying for the rest of this bootstrap (rust, node, the python
# venv, `cargo install lychee`), and so a pin bump cannot leave that job and this
# script on different linters. That file also owns the "the runner image ships
# its own shellcheck" handling and persists its directory to $GITHUB_PATH.
#
# ⛔ NO SILENT SKIP. install-shellcheck.sh exits non-zero on every failure path,
# and `set -e` here propagates it. A bootstrap that "succeeds" without the
# linter produces a lint run that cannot fail, which is the TC-37 vacuous-green
# trap that hid a red `main` for three weeks.
