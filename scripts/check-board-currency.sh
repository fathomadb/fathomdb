# check-board-currency.sh — board/git-ancestry drift detector.
#
# Shared by two callers (status-board-currency-enforcement design, items 2+3):
#   * scripts/preflight.sh --landing (PREVENT, land-time gate)
#   * .github/workflows/ci.yml board-currency job (DETECT, non-bypassable CI
#     backstop on `main` for whatever slips preflight or predates it)
# Reuse, not reimplementation: both callers invoke THIS script so the
# staleness predicate cannot diverge between the two homes.
#
# STALENESS PREDICATE (evidence-based; no network; O(commits) + O(boards), cheap):
#   For every dev/plans/runs/STATUS-0.8.*.md file that is NOT already banner-
#   marked "CLOSED — historical record" in its first 15 lines (the shared
#   predicate in scripts/lib/board-closed.sh; see there for why 15) (i.e. the
#   currently-live release board(s) — closed boards are frozen, nothing lands
#   into them again, so they are out of scope and never scanned):
#     1. Parse the release version from the filename (STATUS-0.8.20.md -> 0.8.20).
#     2. Walk `git log <tip>` (default tip = HEAD; newest-first, git's default
#        order) for commits whose subject matches this repo's own landing-merge
#        convention for that release: `merge(<version>): Slice[- ]<N> ...`.
#        <N> is a DOTTED slice id, not an integer: `39` and `39.5` are two
#        DIFFERENT slices and must never collapse onto one key (SLICE-ID-
#        HARDENING site 1 — see the capture below for the measured consequence).
#     3. Because the walk is newest-first, the FIRST commit seen for a given
#        slice id N is that slice's CURRENT (most recent) land — an
#        intermediate/superseded partial merge for the same slice (there can
#        be more than one across a slice's history) is intentionally NOT
#        re-checked once a newer one for the same N has been seen; only the
#        live state must be reflected, not every past partial land.
#     4. For each slice's current landing commit, require its short SHA
#        (first 8 hex chars) to appear as a literal substring somewhere in
#        the board file. If it does not, that slice landed (by git ancestry —
#        the merge commit is reachable from the tip) while its board never
#        mentions the commit that landed it: a demonstrable contradiction,
#        not a wording heuristic. HARD fail.
#     5. Vacuous-pass guard (fix-1): if step 2 matches ZERO commits for a live
#        board's release, that board contributed zero checks in steps 3-4 and
#        the loop would otherwise pass it by default. HARD fail instead, except
#        for a state-backed newly activated release whose `landed` is empty,
#        whose `next_slice` is its earliest ladder slice, and whose complete
#        ladder remains with no recorded landing evidence — see the dedicated
#        section below.
#     6. BOARD/STATE CROSS-READ (TC-133): steps 2-4 ask git a question. This
#        step asks dev/plans/release-state-<version>.json — the single writer
#        for landed slices, their SHAs and the remaining ladder — whether the
#        board's HAND-WRITTEN rows still agree with it. See the dedicated
#        section below; this is a separate defect from step 2's slice-id
#        capture and its fix is independent.
#
# Steps 1-5 are a floor, not a full semantic reader of the board's prose. Step 6
# is deliberately NARROW rather than a prose reader: it looks only at the
# board's ladder TABLE (a structural region) and at `Ladder remaining:` claims,
# never at free prose, because the current boards' own SUPERSEDED-banner
# convention shows free prose is unreliable to regex over (historical
# close-record sections deliberately retain stale "NOT STARTED" wording as
# history — STATUS-0.8.20.md:1002/1011 do exactly that, and must not be
# flagged). Requiring the literal SHA is something a board legitimately cannot
# satisfy without actually being touched at land time, which is exactly the
# failure this gate closes (the board sat untouched for 4 days after two real
# merges).
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TC-133 — BOARD/STATE CROSS-READ (step 6). Added by HITL ruling 2026-07-30
# (steward seq-212 option (b); todos-ledger seq-197), as §3a of the
# SLICE-ID-HARDENING commission brief.
#
# THE DEFECT, MEASURED. Steps 2-4 require a landing merge's short SHA to appear
# SOMEWHERE in the board file. Throughout a long period
# dev/plans/runs/STATUS-0.8.20.md said Slice 39 was NOT_STARTED and `91db34d8`
# WAS present in the file — but only inside the two `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED -->`
# cells that scripts/check-release-state-views.sh renders from the state file.
# THE GENERATED HALF WAS CARRYING THE CHECK FOR THE HAND-WRITTEN HALF. This
# script exited 0 and the always-on CI job passed too.
#
# ⚠ THIS IS NOT SITE 1 AND THE TWO FIXES ARE INDEPENDENT. At site 1 (the capture
# at the [[ =~ ]] below) the slice-number CAPTURE is wrong. Here the capture is
# correct, the landing merge IS found, its SHA IS present — and the gate still
# certifies a board that contradicts the state file on every hand-written row.
# PRESENCE OF A SHA IS NOT CURRENCY OF THE ROW IT BELONGS TO.
#
# WHAT STEP 6 CHECKS, against dev/plans/release-state-<version>.json:
#   (a) every id in `landed` has a row in the board's ladder table;
#   (b) that row does not describe the slice with a not-started / in-flight /
#       next marker;
#   (c) that row cites the slice's own `ladder[].sha` — the SHA must be in the
#       ROW, not merely in the file. Its PRECONDITION is checked too (fix-2):
#       a slice in `landed` whose `ladder` entry is missing or carries no `sha`
#       is itself a HARD fail, because otherwise (c) would silently not run for
#       that slice and (b), the fragile half, would be the only thing left;
#   (d) every `Ladder remaining:` / `Remaining ladder:` claim names exactly the
#       ids in `remaining_ladder`.
# (c) is the load-bearing half and (b) is the fragile half — see the
# [DETERMINE] block on the marker vocabulary further down.
#
# STATE FILE ABSENT OR UNPARSEABLE — a STATED, VISIBLE policy, because this gate
# loops over EVERY live STATUS-0.8.z.md board and only 0.8.20 currently has a
# release-state file (the single writer arrived with DOC-HYGIENE-2 T2a):
#   * ABSENT -> the cross-read is SKIPPED and SAYS SO on stderr ("cross-read
#     (TC-133) DID NOT RUN"). A hard fail would redden the gate for boards of
#     releases that legitimately predate the single writer; a SILENT skip would
#     rebuild the exact blind spot this step closes, so it is announced.
#   * PRESENT BUT UNPARSEABLE -> HARD fail. That release DOES declare a single
#     writer and the gate cannot vouch for the board without reading it. Same
#     failure family as the fix-1 vacuous-pass guard: never report ok by
#     default. "Unparseable" means bad JSON, a top level that is not an object,
#     a missing `landed`/`ladder`/`remaining_ladder`, one of those three not
#     being a JSON array, or a `ladder` element that is not a JSON object —
#     TYPE, not merely key presence (fix-2 finding B; see the validation below
#     for what a key-only check let through and why it fails OPEN in preflight).
# Both policies are covered by arms in scripts/tests/test_check_board_currency.sh.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Known scope limit: only recognizes the `merge(0.8.z): Slice[- ]N ...` subject
# convention (0.8.20's, the only currently-live board). Older releases used other
# merge-subject shapes (e.g. `merge(0.8.4/Slice 5)`) but their boards are already
# banner-marked CLOSED and are skipped, so this does not affect them. If a future
# release adopts a different merge-subject convention, extend the regex below
# rather than adding a second predicate implementation.
#
# VACUOUS-PASS GUARD (fix-1, same failure class as TC-37's markdownlint-cli2
# hole): the predicate above only fires when a landing-merge subject is FOUND.
# If a LIVE (non-CLOSED, version-parseable) board's release has ZERO commits
# matching the convention reachable from <tip> -- a squash-land, a reworded
# merge, a historical slash-style subject, or simply nothing has landed yet --
# the per-slice loop body never runs, STALE never flips, and the board passes
# green while the gate has actually vouched for nothing. That is a silent
# vacuous pass, not a real currency check, so it is itself a HARD failure:
# every LIVE board must show at least one recognized land, or the gate must say
# loudly that it could not vouch for it (see the "no landing merge matched"
# message below), never report ok by default. The only exception is a newly
# activated state whose empty `landed`, first `next_slice`, and complete
# `remaining_ladder` prove no merge can exist yet. Its earliest (`next`) entry
# may be `IN_PROGRESS` or `NOT_STARTED`; every later entry must be
# `NOT_STARTED`, and none may carry a landing SHA. Its STATUS ladder is
# structurally validated by the unconditional TC-133 cross-read. This can only
# convert a silent pass into a loud failure -- it never fires for a board with
# >=1 matched slice.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-board-currency.sh [--tip <ref>] [--boards-dir <dir>]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every live board's most-recent per-slice land is referenced
#             by SHA (or is a state-backed newly activated release), and every
#             live board with a readable release-state file agrees with it; 1 = at
#             least one demonstrable board/git contradiction, OR a live board
#             matched zero landing merges (vacuous-pass guard, fix-1), OR a
#             board/state contradiction or unreadable state file (TC-133).

# --- [DETERMINE] marker detection: FIXED VOCABULARY, not derived -------------
# DETERMINATION: a fixed, explicitly-listed vocabulary. Reasoning:
#   * There is nothing to derive it FROM. The state file only ever authors
#     POSITIVE status ("LANDED"); it carries no field enumerating words that
#     mean "not done". Deriving the negative set from the complement of the
#     positive one means deriving it from open-ended English — unbounded and
#     unfalsifiable.
#   * The one plausible derivation — "use the `ladder[].status` values the
#     state file currently assigns to non-landed slices" — is SELF-WEAKENING:
#     it shrinks to the empty set exactly when every slice is landed, i.e. at
#     the end of a release, which is precisely when a board is most likely to
#     be stale. And it could only ever contain the STATE FILE's vocabulary,
#     never the BOARD's prose vocabulary — but the board's prose is the thing
#     under test.
#   * A fixed list is auditable: its gaps are visible in one place, here.
#
# ⚠ WHAT THIS REGEX CAN AND CANNOT CATCH — do not over-trust it.
#   CAN:    a landed slice's ladder row that spells out one of the listed
#           markers, in any of the punctuation variants (`NOT_STARTED`,
#           `not-started`, `not started`, `IN FLIGHT`, `in-flight`), behind any
#           markdown emphasis, anywhere in the status cell.
#   CANNOT: any wording not on this list. "pending", "TBD", "queued", "awaiting
#           review", "blocked on X", "0/5 arms green", "—", an empty cell, or a
#           row that is simply months out of date while using upbeat words —
#           ALL PASS THIS CHECK. It is a prose regex; it detects the phrasings
#           someone thought of, and every board that goes stale in a new
#           phrasing goes stale silently as far as (b) is concerned.
#   FALSE-POSITIVES IT WILL PRODUCE (measured against a case matrix, not one
#           example): the state markers match ANYWHERE in the status cell, so a
#           landed slice whose close prose says "closed while in-flight work was
#           parked", or "R-20-PR/R-20-EAV/TC-33 not started; now shipped" (a
#           real phrasing on STATUS-0.8.20.md:316, in another table), IS
#           flagged. That is the intended strictness — a landed slice's own
#           status cell should not contain those words — but it costs a
#           land-blocking hard failure, so it is stated rather than discovered.
#   THEREFORE (b) IS THE FRAGILE HALF AND IS NOT THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. Check
#   (c) below — "the row must cite the slice's own recorded landing SHA" — is
#   derived from the state file, has NO vocabulary at all, and is what would
#   actually have caught the real Slice 39 incident. If you are tempted to
#   trust this gate, trust (c). Widening the vocabulary below is a deliberate
#   act with a false-positive cost: a false positive here HARD-BLOCKS A LAND.
#
# The `next` family is deliberately NOT a bare `\bnext\b`. In a status cell,
# "next" is overwhelmingly a POINTER word ("carried to the next slice",
# "closed; next is Slice 40") rather than a STATE word, and a bare match would
# false-positive on legitimate close prose and block a land. It counts only
# when it is the ENTIRE status cell. Measured cost of that narrowing: a board
# writing "next in queue" for a landed slice is not caught by (b) — it is
# caught by (c).

# AND IT REFUSES A COLLISION RATHER THAN TAKING THE LAST WRITER. `30` and

# Python `30 == 30.0` and `hash(30) == hash(30.0)`, so this is not a
# hypothetical shape). A bare `by_slice[key] = entry` kept whichever entry came
# SECOND in the file — dict-insertion order, i.e. LINE ORDER — and the survivor
# then answered for the loser in check (c) below: a landed row could be
# reconciled against the WRONG entry's SHA, or, when the two agree, a malformed
# state file could be CERTIFIED. That is the same "SILENTLY OVERWRITE" collapse
# check-release-state-views.sh's `_by_slice` was written to forbid, and it
# already refuses it; two readers of one file must not disagree about what that
# file means, so this one refuses it too.
#

# --- (c-pre) STATE COMPLETENESS: a landed slice MUST carry its landing SHA ----
# fix-2 finding A. The original construct was
#     sha = (by_slice.get(key) or {}).get("sha")
#     if sha and sha not in status:
# and both halves fail OPEN. When a slice is listed in `landed` but its `ladder`
# entry is missing, or carries no `sha`, `sha` is None and check (c) — the
# LOAD-BEARING half of this cross-read, the one that would actually have caught
# the real Slice 39 incident — silently DOES NOT RUN for that slice. The gate
# then certifies the hand-written row on the strength of the marker regex (b)
# alone, which its own comment above calls the fragile half. That is precisely
# the state-file INCOMPLETENESS this step was added to catch, so it is reported
# rather than tolerated: `landed` and `ladder[].sha` are two halves of one fact
# and a release whose single writer has only one of them cannot be vouched for.
#
# MEASURED AGAINST THE REAL FILE BEFORE MAKING IT A HARD FAIL: all 14 ids in
# `landed` in dev/plans/release-state-0.8.20.json (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23,
# 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 39) have a `ladder` entry AND a non-null `sha`, zero
# exceptions — so this cannot redden the live gate. Had a real landed slice
# legitimately lacked one, this would have gone back to the Steward instead.
#
# The `sha` must be a NON-EMPTY STRING, not merely truthy-or-present: `sha` is
# used as `sha not in status`, and a non-string there is either a TypeError
# (e.g. a number) or a silently wrong answer.

# --- (d) `Ladder remaining:` prose vs remaining_ladder ----------------------
# Both word orders are matched: the boards use "Ladder remaining: 40 alone" and
# "Remaining ladder: 40 alone" interchangeably for the same claim.
#
# The claim's span is read as an ID LIST — the maximal run of slice ids and
# separators immediately after the marker — and NOT by cutting the line at the
# first punctuation mark. The obvious cut-at-punctuation version was written
# first and was measured wrong on a matrix rather than on one example:
#   "Ladder remaining: 40 alone."                -> {40}      both agree
#   "Ladder remaining: 40 and 41 alone, then ..."-> {40, 41}   both agree
#   "Ladder remaining: 39.5, 40"                 -> cut-at-`,` yields {39.5}
# The third is a COMMA-SEPARATED LADDER, the most natural way to write a
# two-slice remainder, and cutting at the comma silently drops every id after
# the first — a false negative when the board UNDER-claims and a land-blocking
# false positive when it does not. (Cutting at `.` had the same shape against a
# fractional id: `40.5` would have been truncated to `40`, this unit's own
# defect class, which is why the id token below is `[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*` and not
# `[0-9]+`.) Reading a list stops naturally at the first non-id word —
# "alone", "then", "NONE" — so all three cases above come out right.
