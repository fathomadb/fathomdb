# check-c1-conformance.sh — the RUBRIC-H7 `can-i-deploy` contract-conformance
# gate (R-20-H7, plan-0.8.20.md §3).
#
# Shared by two callers, exactly like its siblings scripts/check-ledgers.sh,
# scripts/check-board-currency.sh and scripts/check-governed-surface-pin.sh:
#   * scripts/preflight.sh --landing              (PREVENT, land-time gate)
#   * .github/workflows/ci.yml c1-contract-conformance job
#                                                 (DETECT, always-on backstop)
# Reuse, not reimplementation: both callers invoke THIS script so the predicate
# cannot diverge between the two homes.
#
# WHAT THIS ENFORCES
#   R-20-H7: "a Pact-style can-i-deploy mechanical contract-conformance check:
#   as-built code still satisfies the ratified
#   dev/design/record-lifecycle-protocol/OPP-12-C1-converged-contract.md at the
#   co-land. NOT humans re-reading prose." Acceptance: "Gate exists and is GREEN.
#   An absent-or-failing gate HOLDS the breaking pair." It is a PUBLISH
#   PRECONDITION for the 0.8.20 ↔ Memex 0.5.x-successor breaking pair.
#
#   Every clause of that contract was read and classified exactly once into
#   CHECKABLE / CROSS-REPO / PROSE, and the whole classification is recorded, in
#   reviewable form, in scripts/c1-conformance-pin.json. This gate then does two
#   different jobs, and the difference matters:
#     1. it pins the CONTRACT'S BYTES, so the document cannot move underneath a
#        registry derived from it; and
#     2. it evaluates the CHECKABLE clauses against as-built code.
#
# ================= WHAT THIS GATE DOES *NOT* DO (read this) ==================
# This is a STATIC STRUCTURAL conformance check. It asserts:
#   * the PRESENCE of the symbols, tables, error variants and wiring the
#     contract names;
#   * the ABSENCE of the negative space the contract names (its Q6(b) amendment
#     asserts, as a matter of fact, that no `EntityTypeSpec` and no `id_prefix`
#     exists anywhere under src/ — that is a perfect falsifiable assertion and
#     it is checked as one);
#   * for CLOSED VOCABULARIES ("EXACTLY {unavailable, embedding, ready}", "exactly three
#     roles", "total over exactly those three"), that the enum's variant SET and
#     COUNT and its string mappings are exactly the pinned ones — a structural
#     comparison, NOT a blacklist of the names somebody happened to fear; and
#   * for BEHAVIOURAL obligations, that THE NAMED TEST WHICH PROVES THAT
#     BEHAVIOUR STILL EXISTS IN THE TREE **AND IS STILL AN ACTIVE TEST** —
#     carrying a `#[test]`-family attribute, and not disabled by `#[ignore]` or
#     `#[cfg(..)]` (fix-5).
#
# It does NOT re-execute those behavioural suites, and it therefore does NOT
# prove the behaviour is still correct — only that the proof has not been
# deleted, renamed away, or SWITCHED OFF. `cargo test --workspace` is what
# proves the behaviour; this gate is what notices when the proof disappears,
# stops running, or when the contract's structural obligations are no longer met.
#
# So: it CATCHES a symbol/table/variant that was renamed or removed, a
# forbidden symbol that reappeared, a named test that was deleted OR quietly
# disabled, and any edit to the ratified contract. It DOES NOT catch a
# behavioural regression inside a still-present, still-named, still-running
# test, nor anything the Memex repo does. Claiming otherwise would be a false
# assurance — which is the TC-37 failure class in a different costume.
#
# ===================== PROBE SCOPE — WHY THE ASYMMETRY =======================
# fix-3, codex §9 round 3 findings #1 and #2 [P2]. Every NEGATIVE probe used to
# read ONE FILE — a crate's lib.rs. So a LITERAL, correctly-spelled, fully
# schema-qualified `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE main.property_search_index ...` placed in
# a NEW module beside lib.rs (codex's `fathomdb-engine/src/extra_fts.rs`) exited
# 0, and so did an `INSERT INTO canonical_attributes ...` in a new schema-crate
# module. That is not the residual scope below and not a regex-shape problem: it
# is exactly what this gate claims to catch, in ordinary source text, missed
# because the check was pointed at the wrong subject. The engine crate ALREADY
# carries sibling modules (lifecycle.rs, pcache2.rs); "somebody adds a module" is
# how a crate grows, not an evasion.
#
# THE RULE, AND WHY IT IS NOT SYMMETRIC:
#
#   * NEGATIVE probes (`absent_tree`) are TREE-scoped, always. A negative
#     assertion scoped to one file is only as strong as the assumption that
#     nobody adds a module, and it fails SILENTLY GREEN when that assumption
#     breaks. There is no file-scoped negative probe kind in this script — the
#     `("absent", <file>, regex)` kind was DELETED, not left unused, so writing
#     one again is a deliberate, reviewed act rather than the path of least
#     effort. scripts/tests/test_check_c1_conformance.sh asserts its absence.
#
#   * POSITIVE probes (`present`, `doc_text`) and the STRUCTURAL readers
#     (`in_item`, `fn_sig`, `fn_defined`, `sql_ddl`, `fts_tokenizer_shared`,
#     `enum_exact`, `arms_exact`) legitimately stay FILE-scoped. Their failure
#     mode is the opposite one: a too-narrow positive scope cannot produce a
#     false green, it produces a false RED by construction. If the symbol, the
#     enum or the impl block MOVES to a sibling module, the probe finds 0 matches
#     (or "could not locate a parseable enum") and the gate fails loudly, which
#     is the safe side. Pinning them to a named file also states WHERE the
#     contract's structure is expected to live, which is information a tree-wide
#     search would throw away.
#
#   * A CRATE TREE IS THE COMPLETE SCOPE, not merely a wider one, for the Rust
#     identifier negatives: a variant cannot be added to `enum DenseReadiness` or
#     `enum ProjectionRole` from outside the crate that declares them.
#
# CURRENT INVENTORY (7 negative probes, all tree-scoped; 5 clauses):
#   src                                     Q4-NO-PROVISIONAL (*.rs);
#                                           Q6B-NO-ENTITYTYPESPEC ×3 (all text)
#   fathomdb-schema/src                     Q2-NO-DATA-MIGRATION ×2 (all text)
#   fathomdb-engine/src                     Q4-DENSE-READINESS ×1 (*.rs),
#                                           Q6A-THREE-ROLES ×2 (*.rs),
#                                           Q6B-ID-NON-NULL ×1 (*.rs),
#                                           TE-CUSTOM-TOKENIZER ×1 (all text)
# The SQL negatives use exts=None rather than *.rs on purpose: a migration or a
# DDL carried in a `.sql` file and pulled in with `include_str!` is the same
# violation. The Rust IDENTIFIER negatives use *.rs, because their subject is
# Rust syntax and a mention in a neighbouring note would be a pure false RED.
#
# ==================== RESIDUAL SCOPE — READ BEFORE ROUND 6 ===================
# This gate is a STATIC, LEXICAL check over Rust and SQL SOURCE TEXT. That
# approach has a boundary, and two review rounds were spent tightening regexes
# against it (fix-1: SQL case/whitespace, and blacklist ⇒ closed vocabulary;
# fix-2: schema-qualified table names, and spellings admitted outside a simple
# match arm). Rather than rediscover the boundary again, it is written down here.
#
# NOTE THAT FIX-3, FIX-4 AND FIX-5 ARE NOT ON THIS LIST AND DID NOT BELONG ON IT.
# Round 3 was a bounded SCOPE bug (one file vs the crate tree), round 4 a bounded
# SUBJECT-BINDING bug (a file vs the named table/struct/enum/function the clause
# is about), and round 5 two more bounded ones — the WRONG CRATE'S same-named
# symbol, and a test function that is no longer a test. All three had definite,
# complete fixes and all three were CLOSED, not documented away. The list below
# is the set of things a different MECHANISM would be needed for; it is not a
# place to retire findings to.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE IS. A TRIPWIRE AGAINST DRIFT. Its threat model is a FUTURE
# CONTRIBUTOR who changes as-built code without noticing that a ratified
# cross-repo contract said otherwise — the ordinary way a `can-i-deploy`
# precondition rots. It is NOT a proof of conformance and NOT an adversarial
# control: it cannot stop someone deliberately smuggling a backfill past CI, and
# nothing assembled out of regexes over source text could.
#
# THE CLASSES IT DOES NOT AND CANNOT CATCH, concretely:
#
#   1. DYNAMICALLY COMPOSED SQL. The probes read literal source text. A
#      `format!("INSERT INTO {} SELECT ...", TABLE)`, a `push_str` built from
#      fragments, or a table name held in a `const`/`static` all reach the
#      forbidden table while the text this gate reads contains only `{}`.
#
#   2. ANOTHER ROUTE TO THE SAME TABLE. `qualified()` closes the SPELLINGS of
#      the PINNED NAME (`main.canonical_attributes`, `` `main` . x ``, `[main].x`,
#      any case, any whitespace). It does not close every ROUTE: an ATTACHed
#      database whose alias is chosen at runtime, a VIEW or an `INSTEAD OF`
#      TRIGGER that writes the table under a different name, or an
#      `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` are all invisible to it.
#
#   3. IDENTIFIER INDIRECTION IN RUST. `const PENDING: &str = "pending";` used
#      in place of a literal defeats the string-literal vocabulary check;
#      `macro_rules!` / `paste!`-generated enum bodies and impl blocks are never
#      expanded; `concat_idents!`-style construction defeats the `EntityTypeSpec`
#      / `id_prefix` negative-space probes; a type alias or a re-export under
#      another name defeats the identifier probes.
#
#   4. CONVERSION SURFACES OUTSIDE THE NAMED FUNCTION. `arms_exact` reads exactly
#      `impl <Ty> { fn <fn> }`. An `impl FromStr for <Ty>`, a `From<&str>`, or a
#      free `fn parse_readiness(&str) -> Option<DenseReadiness>` can admit an
#      extra spelling without touching the block this gate reads. This is the
#      clearest proof the approach cannot be COMPLETED by widening: a free
#      function is ordinary Rust, and no impl-scoped check can reach it.
#
#   5. NORMALISING COMPARISONS. `value.to_lowercase()`, `.trim()`,
#      `eq_ignore_ascii_case` widen the accepted vocabulary WITHOUT introducing a
#      new string literal, so the vocabulary check has nothing to see.
#
#   6. CONDITIONAL COMPILATION. Nothing here models `#[cfg(...)]`: text under a
#      disabled feature reads exactly like shipped code, and a violation
#      introduced only behind a feature flag reads exactly like one that is
#      always on. (This class errs RED, not green.)
#
#   7. BEHAVIOUR, and THE MEMEX REPO. Stated above: the behavioural clauses
#      assert only that the NAMED TEST still exists and is still ENABLED, not
#      that it still proves anything, and 12 contract clauses are CROSS-REPO by
#      classification and unverifiable from this repo at all.
#
#   8. WHAT A NAMED TEST'S BODY ACTUALLY ASSERTS. The strongest form of #7, and
#      REWRITTEN AT FIX-5 because the version written at fix-4 claimed more
#      residual than is now true. An over-broad residual is its own dishonesty:
#      it retires a defect that the gate does in fact catch.
#
#      WHAT IS NOW ENFORCED, by `test_defined`, at all four levels a proof can be
#      switched off at:
#        THE FUNCTION   it EXISTS as a definition with a parseable body (not a
#                       comment, not a string literal, not a call); it CARRIES a
#                       `#[test]`-family attribute; it is NOT disabled by
#                       `#[ignore]` / `#[cfg(..)]` / `#[cfg_attr(..)]`.
#        ITS POSITION   it sits at the TOP LEVEL of the integration-test file, so
#                       no enclosing (possibly `#[cfg]`-gated) item can silence it
#                       out of this reader's view.
#        THE FILE       the file's own LEADING HEADER carries no `#![cfg(..)]`
#                       inner attribute, which would switch every proof in it off
#                       at once. Read at the header and nowhere else (fix-6): an
#                       inner attribute inside a nested `mod` belongs to THAT
#                       module, and reading it as the file's was a false RED.
#        THE TARGET     the owning crate's Cargo.toml neither sets
#                       `autotests = false` nor declares a `[[test]]` block for
#                       that file with `required-features` / `test = false`.
#
#      So "delete the proof", "rename it away", "leave only a comment mentioning
#      it", "drop the `#[test]`", "add an `#[ignore]`", "gate the fn", "gate the
#      module", "gate the file" and "gate the target" are ALL closed. The middle
#      two were codex §9 round 5 finding #2; the last four came out of turning
#      that same question on this patch. The TARGET one is not hypothetical:
#      fathomdb-engine/Cargo.toml already carries nineteen `[[test]]` blocks with
#      `required-features`, so it is an established pattern in the very file a
#      contributor would edit.
#
#      WHAT REMAINS, precisely, is three things and no more:
#        (a) THE BODY'S ASSERTIONS. `fn atomic_flip_never_exposes_ready_without
#            _the_vector_under_concurrent_write() { assert!(true); }` satisfies
#            every check above, and so does one whose assertions were commented
#            out. No lexical check can decide whether a body proves the obligation
#            its name claims — `cargo test --workspace` EXECUTING it is what does,
#            it is a required gate, and an emptied body is a visible code diff.
#        (b) THE CRATE, AND THE INVOCATION. This gate reads source and manifest
#            TEXT. It does not know whether the crate is still a workspace member,
#            nor how CI actually invokes cargo (a `--exclude`, a filter argument,
#            a job that stops running).
#        (c) `#[cfg]` INSIDE the body — an assertion compiled out while the test
#            still runs and passes vacuously. This is class #6 again.
#      ALL THREE need the same different mechanism, and it is one mechanism: ask
#      the TOOLCHAIN what the built test binaries actually contain and what they
#      did (`cargo test -- --list`, or `--no-run --message-format=json`), instead
#      of reading text. See the RECOMMENDATION in the closure JSON.
#
# WHICH WAY THE ERRORS FALL. Every ambiguity is resolved toward RED: an
# unparseable enum body, an impl block the reader cannot find, an unreadable file
# and a missing tree are all failures (exit 1 / exit 2), never skips; and the
# text-scoped probes WILL trip on a doc comment or an error message that happens
# to spell the forbidden thing. Noisy false positives, and false negatives
# confined to the list above, is the correct bias for a gate that HOLDS A
# PUBLISH.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT STOPPING POINT. A stronger mechanism exists and is
# deliberately NOT built here: asserting the shipped schema against
# `sqlite_master` at runtime (which sees the table however the SQL was spelled or
# composed), and/or parsing Rust with `syn` (which sees every conversion surface,
# macro-expanded). Both are real work with their own maintenance surface, both
# belong to a slice of their own, and neither is warranted by the threat model
# above. Recorded as a RECOMMENDATION in
# dev/plans/runs/0.8.20-slice-30-output.json, not as a defect being deferred.
#
# CONSEQUENCE FOR REVIEWERS. A finding that this gate misses something ON THE
# LIST ABOVE is TRUE and is NOT a defect in the patch — it is the documented
# scope, and the answer to it is a different mechanism, not another regex. A
# finding that it misses a spelling of a PINNED NAME in LITERAL source text, that
# it misses it because the probe was pointed at the wrong SCOPE, that a probe is
# satisfied by something OTHER THAN THE SUBJECT ITS CLAUSE NAMES, that it is
# pointed at a DIFFERENT CRATE'S same-named symbol, or that a "proof still
# exists" probe is satisfied by a proof that no longer RUNS, is a real defect:
# fix it, and if the fix is another regex, add its class here. Round 3 was the
# second kind (see PROBE SCOPE above), round 4 the third and round 5 the fourth
# and fifth (see A PROBE IS BOUND TO ITS SUBJECT and THE SUBJECT IS A CRATE, NOT
# A SYMBOL NAME, beside the assertion table); all were fixed.
#
# ============================ THE AMENDMENT TRAP =============================
# The contract was AMENDED at efa8d584 ("amend C-1 contract Q6(b) with the TC-11
# cancellation — unblocks the H7 gate"). Before that amendment, clause Q6(b)
# mandated minting an anonymous surrogate `logical_id` — behaviour the ratified
# TC-11 pin A FORBIDS ever implementing, and which as-built code does not
# implement. A gate authored from the un-amended text would have been
# PERMANENTLY RED and would have held the breaking-pair publish forever.
#
# That is precisely why this gate pins the contract's BYTES. The registry below
# describes ONE exact revision of the document. If the document moves, the
# honest answer is not "recompute the hash" — it is RE-DERIVE the clause
# registry from the new text, re-classify every clause, and re-pin under review.
#
# PREDICATE — all four must hold:
#   (a) CONTRACT PIN. sha256 AND git blob sha1 of the contract file's raw bytes
#       equal the pin. Both forms are recorded so a reviewer can reproduce the
#       pin either way (`git rev-parse <commit>:<path>` gives the blob sha1
#       directly). Divergence ⇒ exit 1.
#   (b) CLAUSE-REGISTRY INTEGRITY. The pin records every clause id with its
#       category. This script's implemented assertions and the pin's CHECKABLE
#       set must match IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: a pin id with no implemented
#       assertion (an ORPHAN — the pin over-states what is verified) and an
#       implemented assertion with no pin id (UNREGISTERED — the pinned check
#       set has shrunk) are both a MALFORMED PIN, exit 2.
#   (c) PINNED COUNTS. Per-category counts AND the grand total are pinned and
#       asserted SEPARATELY from the member lists, so an internally inconsistent
#       (botched) re-pin is caught rather than trusted. EVERY count must be
#       PRESENT and an integer: a missing or mistyped count is a MALFORMED PIN
#       (exit 2), never a skipped check. This is the exact hole
#       check-governed-surface-pin.sh had to close — an absent count read back
#       as None and silently disabled its own check, so a re-pin that DELETED a
#       count could buy a green. bool is excluded explicitly because
#       isinstance(True, int) is True in Python.
#   (d) CLAUSE ASSERTIONS. Each CHECKABLE clause's assertion is evaluated
#       against as-built code under --root. Any failure ⇒ exit 1, naming the
#       clause id, quoting the contract obligation, and citing the evidence.
#
# ============ VACUOUS-PASS GUARD — TC-37, five evaporation paths =============
# A gate that cannot see its subject must NEVER report green. ALL FIVE of these
# exit 2, never 0 and never 1:
#   1. python3 is absent.
#   2. the contract file is missing / unreadable.
#   3. the pin file is missing / unreadable / unparseable / MALFORMED.
#   4. a source file a clause's assertion must read is missing or unreadable, OR
#      a source TREE it must scan is absent, OR that tree yields ZERO candidate
#      files (fix-3: a negative assertion that examined nothing has not been
#      evaluated — reporting it satisfied is the vacuous pass in its purest
#      form). In every case the assertion could not be EVALUATED, which is
#      neither a pass nor a clause failure.
#   5. the executed-assertion count is less than the pinned CHECKABLE count —
#      the check set evaporated.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = as-built code conforms to the pinned contract;
#             1 = a REAL DIVERGENCE — the contract moved, or a clause failed.
#                 Route to the Steward / HITL;
#             2 = the gate could not run, or its pin is untrustworthy. This is
#                 deliberately NOT exit 1: exit 1 says "conformance broke, take
#                 it to the Steward", whereas exit 2 says "this gate has no
#                 trustworthy verdict at all".

#                                      STATEMENT is still in the file — its
#                                      subject IS a comment. Never the
#                                      load-bearing half of a clause; see the
#                                      fix-4 note below.
#
# THERE IS NO FILE-SCOPED NEGATIVE PROBE KIND, DELIBERATELY (fix-3). See "PROBE
# SCOPE" in this file's header: every NEGATIVE assertion is `absent_tree`, and
# `("absent", <file>, regex)` was DELETED rather than merely left unused, so
# re-introducing a single-file negative is a deliberate, reviewed act.
#
# AND THERE IS NO COUNT PROBE KIND, DELIBERATELY (fix-4). `("min", path, regex,
# n)` was DELETED for the same reason: a count of file-wide matches is the
# weakest possible relationship between a probe and its subject. See "SUBJECT
# BINDING" in this file's header. scripts/tests/test_check_c1_conformance.sh
# asserts the absence of both kinds.
#
# ------------ CLOSED VOCABULARIES ARE STRUCTURAL, NOT BLACKLISTED ------------
# fix-1, codex §9 round 1 finding #1 [P2]. Three clauses below assert that a
# vocabulary is EXACTLY some set: readiness is
# "EXACTLY {unavailable, embedding, ready}",
# roles are "exactly {filterable, rankable, searchable}", the typed id space is
# "total over exactly those three". Those obligations were originally probed as
# "the members I want are PRESENT" plus, in one case, "one specific bad name is
# ABSENT" — a BLACKLIST OF ONE. A blacklist is not a closed vocabulary: any
# member added under a name nobody thought to forbid walks straight through, and
# the gate reports 0 on a tree that violates the contract. codex demonstrated it
# with `pub enum DenseReadiness { Ready, Embedding, Failed }`.
#
# `enum_exact` / `arms_exact` close that by CONSTRUCTION: they parse the enum
# body and the match arms, count the members, and compare the member SET against
# the pinned one. A third variant fails whatever it is called; a third accepted
# string spelling fails even when the enum is untouched. That is the difference
# between "the names I feared are absent" and "the vocabulary is closed".
#
# ------------------ SQL IS CASE-INSENSITIVE (AND WHITESPACE) -----------------
# fix-1, codex §9 round 1 finding #2 [P2]. An `absent` probe over SQL that
# anchors on ONE uppercase spelling with single spaces is a false negative:
# SQLite accepts `insert into t`, `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO t`, `INSERT OR IGNORE
# INTO   t` and a newline anywhere whitespace is legal. codex cleared the gate
# with a single lowercase line. Every negative-space probe whose subject is SQL
# now goes through `insert_into()` / an explicit `(?i)` pattern that tolerates
# the five SQLite conflict clauses and arbitrary whitespace.
#
# Rust IDENTIFIER probes (`ProjectionRole::Vector`, `EntityTypeSpec`,
# `id_prefix`) are deliberately left case-SENSITIVE: case is significant in Rust,
# so folding case there would create false positives, not close a hole.
#
# ----------------- A SQL TABLE NAME IS `[<schema>.]<table>` ------------------
# fix-2, codex §9 round 2 findings #1 and #2 [P2]. fix-1 widened these probes for
# CASE and WHITESPACE but still required the pinned table name IMMEDIATELY after
# `INTO` / `TABLE`. That is not how SQLite names a table: every table reference
# may carry a schema qualifier, and `main.` is ALWAYS valid for the main
# database. `INSERT INTO main.canonical_attributes ...` therefore writes exactly
# the forbidden table and cleared the gate with 0; so did `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE
# main.property_search_index ...`. `qualified()` below tolerates one optional
# schema identifier — quoted, bracketed or bare, with whitespace around the dot,
# which SQLite also accepts.
#
# NOTE WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** REACH: an ATTACHed alias whose NAME is chosen at
# runtime, or a table reached through a view/trigger under a different name, is
# still invisible here — see RESIDUAL SCOPE in this file's header. `qualified()`
# closes the spellings of the PINNED name, not every route to the pinned table.
#
# ------------- A PROBE IS BOUND TO ITS SUBJECT, NOT TO A FILE ----------------
# fix-4, codex §9 round 4 [P2] and the sweep it triggered. The FOURTH distinct
# class, and the most general one: a probe asserted that some text existed
# SOMEWHERE IN A FILE, while the clause it implements is about a NAMED SUBJECT
# inside that file. An unrelated coincidence elsewhere in the same file then
# satisfied the probe while the named subject was broken.
#
# codex's demonstration: `C1-TE-DEFAULT-TOKENIZER` COUNTED file-wide occurrences
# of `tokenize = 'porter unicode61 remove_diacritics 2'` in the schema crate
# (`min`, n=2). That file already carries several — for `search_index`,
# `search_index_v2` and the edge index. Changing ONLY `property_search_index`'s
# tokenizer left the count satisfied by tables the clause is not about, and the
# gate exited 0 on a tree where the property-FTS no longer shares the engine's
# default tokenizer. A COUNT IS NOT A BINDING; the `min` kind is gone.
#
# THE SWEEP found the same shape in fifteen more clauses, each with a working
# demonstration in the test suite (arms 12v–12ac): a `pub <field>: <ty>,` probe
# satisfied by ANY struct rather than the one the contract names (seven clauses);
# an error-variant probe satisfied by the Display impl after the variant was
# deleted from the enum (two); the apply verb's three signature fragments probed
# independently, so they need not describe one function; a statement probed
# file-wide rather than inside the verb whose body the clause is about (two); a
# `fn <name>(` probe that cannot tell a DEFINITION from a COMMENT mentioning it
# (every behavioural clause); an index probed by NAME while the clause is about
# its COLUMNS; a registry column probed file-wide; and a plan requirement ROW
# probed as a bare `| id |` mention.
#
# THE RULE, in priority order:
#   1. STRUCTURAL EXTRACTION bound to the named subject (`in_item`, `fn_sig`,
#      `fn_defined`, `sql_ddl`, `fts_tokenizer_shared`, `enum_exact`,
#      `arms_exact`). Preferred always.
#   2. A `present` regex tight enough that it CANNOT be satisfied by a different
#      declaration — it must name its subject (a unique symbol/table/index name,
#      a const together with its value, a whole table row).
#   3. There is no 3. Counts are gone.
#
# WHICH WAY THE STRUCTURAL READERS ERR: a subject they cannot locate is a CLAUSE
# FAILURE (exit 1), never a skip, exactly like `enum_exact`. Where a name could
# denote several items the readers take the STRICT side — every `struct`/`enum`/
# `fn` body of that name must satisfy the probe — except for `impl`, where a
# type's inherent impl may legitimately be split across blocks and ANY block
# suffices (every one of them is still `impl <the named type>`, so the subject
# binding holds either way).
#
# ------------ THE SUBJECT IS A CRATE, NOT A SYMBOL NAME (fix-5) --------------
# codex §9 round 5 finding #1 [P2]. A REFINEMENT of the fix-4 class, and a
# different question from the one fix-4's own audit asked. fix-4 asked "is this
# probe bound to a SUBJECT at all, or merely to a file?". Round 5 asks the next
# question: "is it bound to the subject THE CLAUSE NAMES, or to a DIFFERENT FILE
# THAT HAPPENS TO CONTAIN A SIMILAR SYMBOL?" — and a probe can be perfectly,
# structurally bound and still be bound to the wrong thing.
#
# The instance: `C1-TE-DEFAULT-EMBEDDER`'s obligation is "the default embedder is
# THE ENGINE'S SHIPPED DEFAULT". The probe read `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER_NAME` out of
# the EMBEDDER crate's `candle_bge.rs`. Both crates declare a constant of that
# exact name; only the engine's is the engine's shipped default. codex changed
# `fathomdb-engine/src/lib.rs`'s `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER_NAME` to `"some-other-model"`
# and the gate exited 0.
#
# THE FIX is not to swap one crate for the other — that would drop a real half of
# the obligation. The two constants MUST AGREE: the engine fails closed on an
# embedder identity mismatch (ADR-0.6.0-vector-identity-embedder-owned), so a
# divergence between "the name the engine expects by default" and "the name the
# pinned embedder reports" is a broken shipped default, not a cosmetic drift.
# `const_str_agree` therefore asserts the RELATION, exactly as
# `fts_tokenizer_shared` does for the sibling tokenizer clause: both constants
# must exist as declarations, must carry the same string, and that string must be
# the pinned one.
#
# THE FIX-5 RE-AUDIT of all 26 CHECKABLE clauses against this question found NO
# second instance — every other probe's file is the crate the clause names (see
# the closure JSON for the clause-by-clause table). One clause is deliberately
# WIDER than its own wording: `C1-Q4-NO-PROVISIONAL-CONCEPT` says "in engine
# code" and is scanned over the whole of `src/`. That is the SAFE direction for a
# negative (it can only produce a false RED), and it is what the pin's own
# recorded evidence asserts, so it stays.
#
# ---------------- A DISABLED TEST IS NOT A PROOF (fix-5) --------------------
# codex §9 round 5 finding #2 [P2], and the TC-37 evaporation shape this whole
# gate exists to close. Ten clauses are carried by "the named test that proves
# this still exists in the tree". `fn_defined` proved a DEFINITION existed — so
# DELETING `#[test]`, or ADDING `#[ignore]`, left a plain function of the same
# name, `fn_defined` still passed, and `cargo test` silently stopped running the
# proof. Nothing anywhere went red.
#
# That is strictly worse than residual class #8 as fix-4 stated it. #8's claim
# was "an emptied body is review-visible" — true, and an emptied body genuinely
# is a diff a human reads. But a deleted attribute is a ONE-TOKEN edit that looks
# like tidy-up, and unlike an emptied body it IS closeable lexically. So it was
# closed, for ALL FOURTEEN test probes across the ten behavioural clauses.
# `fn_defined` survives ONLY for the four PRODUCTION functions, and the gate now
# REFUSES (exit 2, internal error) to evaluate `fn_defined` against a path under
# `tests/` so the weaker kind cannot drift back onto a proof.
#
# AND THEN THE SAME QUESTION, TURNED ON THIS PATCH: `test_defined` reads the
# attributes ON THE FUNCTION, so a proof can carry a pristine `#[test]` and still
# never run because something ABOVE it was switched off. Three more routes, all
# lexical, all of which exited 0 against the first cut of this fix:
#   * the proof NESTED inside a `#[cfg]`-gated `mod` (attributes on the module,
#     not on the fn);
#   * a `#![cfg(..)]` INNER attribute switching the whole FILE off;
#   * a `[[test]]` block in the crate's Cargo.toml carrying `required-features`
#     (or `test = false`, or `autotests = false`), which gates the whole TARGET.
# The last is the important one, and it is NOT hypothetical: fathomdb-engine's
# Cargo.toml ALREADY declares nineteen such blocks, because that is how the crate
# legitimately keeps operator-only and reranker-only suites out of the default
# build. "Somebody adds a required-features to a test target" is an established
# pattern in the exact file a contributor would edit — the fix-3 sibling-module
# argument, one level up. All four levels are checked now.
#
# `#[cfg(..)]` is rejected on a proof, on its module and on its file
# deliberately, and it is the judgement call here: a legitimately feature-gated
# proof goes RED. That is the safe side (a false RED a human resolves), and it
# matches the bias stated under WHICH WAY THE ERRORS FALL. What it must NOT be
# mistaken for is completeness — see residual class #8 for exactly the three
# things that remain.
#
# NO PYTHON OR TYPESCRIPT TEST IS CITED BY ANY CLAUSE. `--list-sources` is the
# authority: the gate reads seven files (four Rust, one markdown plan, and the
# two crate lib.rs) and three trees, and not one `.py` or `.ts` among them. The
# same evaporation exists in those languages (`@pytest.mark.skip`, `xfail`,
# `describe.skip` / `it.skip` / `.only`, a renamed-away `test_` prefix), so if a
# future clause ever cites one, it needs its own `test_defined` equivalent — not
# a `present` probe on a function name.

#
# Why it matters: without it, `const S: &str = "fn foo() { }";` reads exactly
# like a definition and `"pub enum DenseReadiness { Ready, Embedding }"` exactly
# like a declaration — so a deleted test, or a THIRD enum variant with a decoy

    A `#![cfg(..)]` there switches the WHOLE FILE off, which for an integration
    test means every proof in it stops running while each one still reads as a
    perfectly ordinary `#[test]`.

    "IN THE HEADER" IS LOAD-BEARING (fix-6, codex §9 round 6 finding #2). This
    used to scan the whole file for `#![`, but Rust permits an inner attribute at
    the head of ANY braced item, and `mod helpers { #![cfg(feature = "x")] .. }`
    is ordinary, legal, and switches off THAT MODULE alone. Reading one of those
    as "the whole test file is conditionally compiled" turns this gate RED and
    blocks CI and `preflight.sh --landing` while every top-level pinned proof
    still builds and runs — a FALSE RED, which on a publish precondition is its
    own failure mode, not the safe side.

    So the walk starts at the top of the file and stops at the first thing that
    is neither whitespace nor an inner attribute — i.e. at the first item. That
    leading run IS the file header, and it is the only place a FILE-level inner
    attribute may legally appear, so narrowing to it gives up nothing: a genuine
    `#![cfg(..)]` is still found when it sits alone at the head, after other
    leading inner attributes, or after a `//!` doc header (comments, `//!`
    included, are already blanked to spaces by `rust_view`, so a doc header does
    not end the run).

    A LEADING SHEBANG IS PART OF THAT HEADER AND IS SKIPPED FIRST (fix-6b, codex
    §9 round 6 RE-REVIEW of the fix-6 patch — a regression the narrowing itself
    opened). A Rust source file may legally begin with `#!/usr/bin/env ..`, which
    is not `#![`, so the walk ended at byte 0 and never saw a file-level
    `#![cfg(..)]` on the NEXT line: the whole test file compiled out, gate green.
    `rustc --test` on shebang + `#![cfg(feature = "nope")]` + `#[test] fn t() {}`
    builds and `--list` reports `0 tests`. rustc's own rule is followed exactly:
    ONLY the very first line can be a shebang, and it is one only when the file
    starts with `#!` whose next character is NOT `[` — `#![..]` at byte 0 is an
    inner attribute, not a shebang. The rest of that first line is skipped and
    the leading-attribute walk resumes, so an attribute run after a shebang is
    still read (and the nested-module false RED above stays closed).

    A LEADING UTF-8 BOM IS ALSO PART OF THAT HEADER AND IS SKIPPED FIRST OF ALL
    (fix-6c, the COMPLETION of that same finding #2 — its scope is the file's own
    leading inner attributes, and a BOM-prefixed one is one of them). `read_source`
    decodes with `errors="replace"`, which does NOT strip a byte-order mark, so a
    BOM arrives here as U+FEFF at index 0 and defeated the walk three ways at once:
    it is not `#!`, so the shebang branch was skipped; `"﻿".isspace()` is False in
    Python 3 — U+FEFF is category Cf, a FORMAT character, not whitespace — so the
    whitespace skip did not advance past it; and it is not `#![`, so the walk broke
    at byte 0 and never saw a file-level `#![cfg(..)]` on that very line. Same false
    green as the shebang hole, through a different first byte: `rustc --test` on
    bytes `ef bb bf` + `#![cfg(feature = "nope")]` + `#[test] fn t() {}` builds and
    `--list` reports `0 tests`, while the same file without the cfg reports `1 test`.
    rustc's ordering is followed exactly — it strips ONE leading BOM, and only THEN
    may the first line be a shebang — so this skip runs BEFORE the shebang branch
    and BOM + shebang + `#![cfg(..)]` is read too. The strip is local to this walk;
    `read_source` is deliberately left alone so no other probe's view changes. Only
    ONE BOM is stripped, as rustc does: a second U+FEFF is not a header byte.
