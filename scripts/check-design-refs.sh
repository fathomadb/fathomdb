# check-design-refs.sh — TC-92 (DOC-HYGIENE-3): A REQUIREMENT ID MUST HAVE
# DESIGN COVERAGE AT THE MOMENT IT IS MINTED.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE MEASURED FAILURE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# At the Slice 22 commission, `scripts/commission-manifest.sh 0.8.20 22` exited 1:
#     ZERO design docs matched 0.8.20 Slice 22 (tokens: TC-67, TC-68, R-20-VC)
# — its TC-37 vacuous-pass guard, working exactly as designed, refusing to emit a
# brief whose required-reading list would be empty.
#
# THE GUARD WAS RIGHT AND THE ALARM WAS REAL, but the diagnosis was NOT "the
# design does not exist". It existed for every leg and was found in minutes:
# TC-67 in `record-lifecycle-protocol/projection-registry-and-async-embed.md`,
# TC-68 in `0.8.18-slice-5-vector-equivalence-probe.md`, decision #18 in
# `errors.md`, sqlite-vec #99 in `vector.md`. None of them MENTIONED TC-67,
# TC-68 or R-20-VC, because those ids were minted 2026-07-27, long after the
# documents were written. A LITERAL TOKEN SCAN CANNOT SEE A DEPENDENCY THAT RUNS
# BACKWARD IN TIME, which is the normal direction for a reserved-gap slice
# consuming older design.
#
# THE CONSEQUENCE IS BIMODAL, and the quiet half is the dangerous one. Zero
# matches HARD-FAILS and cannot be commissioned at all — loud, recoverable, and
# what happened to Slice 22. ONE weak incidental match emits a brief whose
# required reading is thin but LOOKS complete. Slice 21 was that shape: it
# matched exactly one document, on TC-71, and the manifest honestly printed
# `NO design doc mentions: ac_002, TC-57, R-20-CR`. The line was correct and was
# easy to read past.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS ALREADY FIXED, AND WHY THIS IS STILL NEEDED
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Slice 22 was unblocked by hand-annotating five documents with a "Requirement
# traceability" blockquote. That approach is SUPERSEDED by `design_refs` — a
# curated per-ladder-entry citation list on the state file (d30ef52f) — and is
# not the remedy here.
#
# THE UNFIXED HALF IS THE DISCIPLINE GAP: nothing requires a back-link at the
# moment a requirement id is minted. TC-92 records that as remedy (a), "a
# checklist item at exactly the moment the knowledge exists". A checklist is a
# convention; this file is the mechanical version, and `scripts/hooks/pre-commit`
# fires it exactly when the state file or the design tier is staged — which is
# the commit in which a new id gets minted.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE PREDICATE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For every ladder entry of every `dev/plans/release-state-*.json`, every token
# the entry declares must have DESIGN COVERAGE, by one of:
#   (i)  a design document whole-token matches it under the manifest's own
#        selectors — i.e. it was back-linked; or
#   (ii) one of the entry's curated `design_refs` documents whole-token matches
#        it — the route for a document the manifest's walker cannot reach; or
#   (iii) it is listed in the FROZEN BASELINE EXEMPTION table below.
# Anything else is a hard failure naming the slice, the token and both remedies.
#
# WHY PER-TOKEN AND NOT PER-ENTRY. "The entry has SOME `design_refs`, therefore
# every token it declares is covered" would be a blanket pass: mint a new
# requirement id on a slice that already carries one curated citation and the
# check would never fire. That is precisely the quiet mode TC-92 is about, and
# it would make this a snapshot rather than a ratchet. Coverage is asked
# token-by-token, which is also the granularity the manifest itself reports at.
#
# WHY NOT "SKIP LANDED SLICES". That is the cheap way to make the baseline green
# and it is wrong: it would let a NEW gap through on a landed slice, and landed
# slices are re-commissioned (a historical regeneration is an explicitly
# supported manifest mode). The two known-uncovered tokens are enumerated
# individually instead, so the set can only shrink by accident and can only grow
# by a deliberate edit here.
#
# NO TOKEN DERIVATION OF ITS OWN. This check DRIVES `commission-manifest.sh` and
# reads its coverage report; it never re-derives what a slice's tokens are.
# TC-100 is the standing proof that the matching rule is subtle (`"C-1" in
# "TC-15"` is True, which once padded Slice 15's required reading to eighteen
# documents), and two tools disagreeing about a slice's design coverage would be
# worse than either alone. The one thing this file must reproduce — the
# whole-token boundary, for curated documents the manifest's walker never reads —
# is asserted to be byte-identical to the manifest's at every run, and the check
# REFUSES TO RUN if it has changed (TC-37: a gate that cannot run must not report
# a pass).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `--staged-only` JUDGES THE INDEX, NOT THE WORKING TREE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A commit-time gate must reason about THE CONTENT THAT WILL BE COMMITTED. This
# is the same lesson `check-staged-ledger-sidecars.sh` records for TC-88: reading
# the worktree goes green for the author and red for everyone downstream. Under a
# PARTIAL COMMIT a worktree read is wrong in both directions:
#   * FALSE PASS — a staged ladder entry mints an id, and the back-link exists
#     only as an UNSTAGED edit. The commit lands with no design of record and the
#     gate said nothing. That is exactly the quiet mode TC-92 is about, arriving
#     through the gate built to stop it.
#   * FALSE BLOCK — an unrelated unstaged edit removes coverage, and a clean
#     staged commit is refused. On the ACTIVE commit path that is the TC-121
#     hazard: `seat-path-guard.sh` false-positived and two independent agents
#     learned to route around it.
#
# SO THE SWEEP RUNS OVER A SNAPSHOT OF THE INDEX. `git checkout-index --all
# --prefix` materialises exactly the bytes `git commit` is about to write into a
# throwaway tree, and the manifest is driven THERE. Measured before it was built,
# because the whole approach depends on it: `commission-manifest.sh` needs git
# for one thing only — `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` — so an empty
# `git init` in the snapshot is enough, and its output for a real slice is
# BYTE-IDENTICAL to the worktree run. The manifest is NOT modified; byte-identity
# is its safety argument and it stays intact. Cost: ~0.26s for 2121 files.
#
# NO GIT WRITE, EVER — AND THAT IS A STRUCTURAL PROPERTY, NOT A PROMISE (TC-128)
# This script invokes exactly four git commands, and every one of them is
# READ-ONLY:
#     git rev-parse --show-toplevel        (resolve the repo root)
#     git --no-optional-locks diff --cached --name-only   (the trigger scan)
#     git ls-files --unmerged              (the cannot-certify probe)
#     git checkout-index --all --prefix=…  (writes ONLY inside $SNAPSHOT)
# There is NO `git init`, no `git config`, no `git add`, no `git stash`, nothing
# that can alter a repository. The snapshot is made a git repository BY HAND with
# `mkdir` and `printf`; no git binary is involved in creating it.
#
# WHY IT IS BUILT THAT WAY, measured twice on 2026-07-29 (18:14:51 and 18:26:28).
# An earlier version called `git init "$SNAPSHOT"`. A real linked-worktree
# pre-commit hook — how every orchestrated commit in this repo is made — exports
# `GIT_DIR` as an ABSOLUTE path, and with GIT_DIR set `git init` DOES NOT create
# `$SNAPSHOT/.git`: GIT_DIR wins and git reinitialises the repository GIT_DIR
# names. Both times that was the PRIMARY CHECKOUT, whose `.git/config` gained
# `bare = true`, breaking every work-tree operation there while `git rev-parse
# HEAD` still resolved — half-alive, not obviously broken. (A plain checkout
# exports no `GIT_DIR` and a RELATIVE `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, which is why testing only
# that shape reproduces the harmless case and misses this one entirely.)
#
# Ordering the environment scrub correctly WOULD also have fixed it. That was
# rejected: it leaves a gate on the commit path whose worst-case failure is
# corrupting the repository it guards, and which any later edit moving one line
# can re-arm. With no write anywhere in the path, the worst case of a leaked
# GIT_* is a WRONG ANSWER FROM A DOCS-HYGIENE GATE. Take the route where damage
# is impossible, not the one where it is unlikely.
#
# THE ENVIRONMENT BOUNDARY STILL MATTERS FOR CORRECTNESS (not for safety):
#   REAL-REPO SIDE, environment INTACT: the trigger scan, the unmerged probe and
#     `checkout-index` MUST see the hook's `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, because a PARTIAL
#     commit (`git commit -- <paths>`) puts the content that will be committed
#     into a TEMPORARY index and names it there (measured:
#     `.git/next-index-*.lock`). Scrubbing before them would snapshot the wrong
#     tree and silently reintroduce the worktree-vs-index defect.
#   SNAPSHOT SIDE, environment SCRUBBED: the manifest, and the self-check below.
# And the snapshot is required to RESOLVE TO ITSELF before the sweep runs, so a
# git call can never quietly answer about a different tree.
#
# THE RESIDUAL, NAMED RATHER THAN IMPLIED. Two states cannot be certified and are
# reported LOUDLY and then let through (exit 0), never failed: an UNMERGED index,
# and a snapshot that cannot be built. This deliberately diverges from
# `check-staged-ledger-sidecars.sh`, which exits 2 on an unmerged path — that
# gate protects an invariant which conflict resolution actively breaks, whereas
# this one is a coverage discipline where a refusal nobody can act on costs more
# than the miss. A merge commit touching `dev/design/**` must not be blocked by a
# gate that simply could not look.
#
# READ-ONLY, and LOCAL-ONLY. It writes nothing inside the repository (the
# snapshot lives under `mktemp -d` and is removed on exit). It is wired into the
# pre-commit hook and deliberately NOT into `preflight.sh --landing` (every check
# there is paired with a mirrored CI job, and this one has no mirror) nor into
# `agent-test.sh` nor `.github/**`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-design-refs.sh                      # sweep every release
#   scripts/check-design-refs.sh --release 0.8.20     # one release
#   scripts/check-design-refs.sh --release 0.8.20 --slice 22
#   scripts/check-design-refs.sh --staged-only        # pre-commit: self-gates
#                                                     # and judges the INDEX
# Exit: 0 = every declared token has coverage (or a frozen exemption), or
#           --staged-only found nothing relevant staged, or it announced that it
#           could not certify this commit (unmerged index / no snapshot);
#       1 = an uncovered token; 2 = the gate could not run.
