# check-governed-surface-pin.sh — governed-surface pin gate (DOC-HYGIENE-2 T1e).
#
# Shared by two callers, exactly like its siblings scripts/check-ledgers.sh and
# scripts/check-board-currency.sh:
#   * scripts/preflight.sh --landing                 (PREVENT, land-time gate)
#   * .github/workflows/ci.yml governed-surface-pin job
#                                                    (DETECT, always-on backstop)
# Reuse, not reimplementation: both callers invoke THIS script so the predicate
# cannot diverge between the two homes.
#
# WHAT THIS ENFORCES
#   The HITL signed the accumulated governed-surface delta of 0.8.20 Slices
#   5d + 10b + 15b + 15d (AC-079), then 0.8.21 Slice 60's projected-text search
#   delta, 0.8.22 Slice 21's DenseReadiness type commentary, and 0.8.22 Slice
#   22's C5 projection-status reads (steward-ledger seq-247), and the approved
#   0.8.25 Slice 20/25/30/35/40 surfaces — pinned to the EXACT CONTENT of
#   src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json at the commit recorded in
#   scripts/governed-surface-pin.json: 54 allowlist members,
#   5 core, and recovery_denylist unchanged at the five
#   REQ-054 names. A signature keyed to specific content is worth exactly as much
#   as the mechanism that notices when that content moves. This is that
#   mechanism: the signed content is recorded in scripts/governed-surface-pin.json
#   and this gate HARD-fails the moment the file diverges from it, routing the
#   reader back to the HITL for a fresh sign-off.
#
# TRIPPING THIS GATE IS CORRECT BEHAVIOUR, NOT A BUG: the signature covers the
# pinned content, and anything else re-opens it. Re-pinning to make the gate
# green without a fresh HITL sign-off is the failure mode the gate exists to
# prevent.
#
# ⚠ CORRECTED 2026-07-26 (HITL, steward ledger seq-113). An earlier revision of
# this header claimed tripping the gate "is precisely what lets Slices 20/25/30
# proceed WITHOUT stopping for a per-slice sign-off". THAT CLAIM WAS FALSE, and
# the mechanism it described does not exist. This gate hashes the file's RAW
# BYTES (predicate (a) below) and `scripts/preflight.sh` treats a FAIL as `hard`,
# refusing to certify the tree for landing. So the procedure that claim implied —
# record the delta as a `_comment` proposal and land — is NOT executable: the
# `_comment` edit IS a byte diff, so writing the proposal blocks the very land it
# was meant to permit. A trip is a genuine HALT, not a soft signal.
#
# HISTORICAL 0.8.20 STRATEGY (TC-59, option (b)): the `_comment` prose
# correction (TC-52) and its accumulated delta were signed in one ceremony at
# the Slice 30 -> Slice 40 boundary. That did not create a `pending_delta`
# mechanism or authorize future surface changes: each later byte change, such
# as the signed 0.8.22 Slice 22 C5 delta, needs its own explicit HITL decision
# before this pin can be re-issued.
#
# IF IT DOES TRIP: HALT and escalate to the Steward. Do not work around it, do
# not re-pin, do not edit the pinned file to make it pass.
#
# PREDICATE — the pinned file must match the pin on ALL of:
#   (a) CONTENT HASH: sha256 and git blob sha1 of the file's raw bytes equal the
#       values recorded in the pin. Both are recorded so a reviewer can
#       reproduce the pin either way (`git rev-parse <pinned_at_commit>:<file>`
#       gives the blob sha1 directly).
#   (b) MEMBER LISTS: `allowlist`, `core` and `recovery_denylist` are compared
#       element-by-element against the copies stored in the pin, so the failure
#       can name WHICH member appeared or vanished — and so that updating only
#       the hash in the pin (a lazy re-pin, to silence the gate) still fails.
#   (c) COUNTS: the exact values in the pin, asserted separately from (b)
#       against the pin's own
#       `counts` block, so a pin whose lists and counts disagree is caught as an
#       internally inconsistent (botched) re-pin rather than being trusted.
#       EVERY one of the three counts must be PRESENT and an integer: a count the
#       gate cannot read is a MALFORMED PIN (exit 2), never a skipped check. An
#       absent count used to read back as None and silently disable both halves
#       of (c) for that list, so a re-pin that DELETED a count, added a member
#       and recomputed the hashes exited 0 — disarming the very backstop that
#       makes a lazy re-pin (b) impossible to hide.
#   (d) REQ-054: `recovery_denylist` is EXACTLY {recover, restore, repair, fix,
#       rebuild}, checked against a constant HARDCODED BELOW — in the FILE and in
#       the PIN. This rule (AC-041) is independently load-bearing: the recovery
#       denylist is five names, and it must not silently widen even by way of an
#       otherwise well-formed re-pin. This is the one check a re-pin cannot buy
#       its way past.
#
# WHITESPACE / FORMATTING-ONLY CHANGES FAIL. DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED CHOICE:
#   (a) is a CONTENT hash over raw bytes, so re-indenting the file, reordering
#   keys, or adding a trailing newline HARD-fails even though the parsed members
#   are unchanged. The pin is a statement about a file's content at a commit, not
#   about its abstract meaning — and a "harmless reformat" is the ideal cover for
#   a member slipped in on an adjacent line. When only formatting moved, the
#   failure says so explicitly (the parsed members are reported as identical), so
#   the reader is never left guessing whether the surface actually changed.
#
# VACUOUS-PASS GUARD (TC-37, this repo's named failure class): if the pinned file
# is MISSING or UNREADABLE, this gate HARD-fails — it never exits 0. A gate that
# cannot see its subject and reports green is worse than no gate: it is an active
# false assurance. A vanished governed-surface allowlist is also, on its face, the
# largest possible change to the governed surface.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-governed-surface-pin.sh [--file <path>] [--pin <path>] [--help]
#
# --file/--pin exist so the test fixtures can point at COPIES under mktemp -d; the
# real src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json is never written by the
# tests (mutating it is the exact thing this gate exists to catch). Both callers
# invoke the script with no arguments. (--help mirrors scripts/set-version.sh, the
# one sibling that offers it.)
#
# Requires python3 for JSON parsing and hashing. If it is absent this script exits
# 2 (env error) LOUDLY rather than skipping — a skip here would be the TC-37 hole.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = the pinned file matches the pin on (a)-(d);
#             1 = divergence from the pin, OR the pinned file is missing /
#                 unreadable / unparseable (vacuous-pass guard), OR the pin
#                 itself breaches REQ-054 or is internally inconsistent;
#             2 = usage error, unreadable/unparseable/MALFORMED pin file, or
#                 python3 absent (the gate could not run — never reported as a
#                 pass). "Malformed" is structural: a missing/mistyped field the
#                 predicate reads. That is deliberately NOT exit 1: exit 1 says
#                 "the surface diverged, take it back to the HITL", whereas a
#                 malformed pin means the gate has no trustworthy statement of
#                 what was signed at all.
