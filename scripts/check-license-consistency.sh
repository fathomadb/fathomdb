# check-license-consistency.sh — license type + license-SHIPPING gate
# (0.8.20 Slice 39, R-20-DOC; HITL license ruling seq-193).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Across the entire 0.8.x line the repo-root LICENSE said MIT while every
#   publishable manifest said Apache-2.0, and NO published artifact carried a
#   license file at all — not one of the 7 crates, not the wheel, not either npm
#   package. Nothing noticed, because nothing looked. Per standing policy, a
#   guardrail that was slipped gets a mechanism, not a note: this is that
#   mechanism.
#
#   crates.io versions are IMMUTABLE. Publishing a crate whose manifest declares
#   the wrong license, or that carries no license text, is not fixable after the
#   fact — only supersedable. That is why this is a gate and not a lint.
#
# WHAT IT ENFORCES — two halves, both required.
#
#   (i) TYPE AGREEMENT. The repo-root LICENSE is AUTHORITATIVE. Its type is
#       DERIVED from its own first line (not hardcoded), so relicensing the
#       project moves this gate with it instead of against it. Every publishable
#       manifest's license field must equal that type:
#         - [workspace.package].license in the root Cargo.toml
#         - every publishable workspace member (inherited or literal)
#         - src/python/pyproject.toml [project].license
#         - src/ts/package.json .license
#         - src/ts/package-lock.json .packages[""].license   <- the ROOT entry only
#         - every src/ts/npm/*/package.json .license
#
#       ⚠ src/ts/package-lock.json: ONLY the `""` root-package entry is checked
#       and only it may ever be edited. Every other "license" in that file is a
#       DEPENDENCY's own recorded licence — a factual record (node_modules/
#       typescript really is Apache-2.0). A global find-and-replace there would
#       corrupt the lockfile into lying about third-party licences.
#
#  (ii) THE LICENSE TEXT ACTUALLY SHIPS, asserted against the PACKAGING TOOL'S
#       OWN FILE LIST — never against the config that is supposed to cause it.
#       Grading a packaging change by re-reading the change is the failure mode
#       this whole slice exists to correct.
#
# COVERAGE HONESTY — which of the ten published units are checked how:
#
#   | unit                              | how (default run)                    |
#   |-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
#   | 7 publishable crates              | REAL `cargo package --list`          |
#   | npm `fathomdb`                    | REAL `npm pack --dry-run --json`     |
#   | npm `fathomdb-<triple>` | REAL `npm pack --dry-run --json`     |
#   | the PyPI wheel                    | MECHANISM PROXY (see below)          |
#
#   The wheel is the ONE unit not covered by real packaging output by default,
#   because building it compiles the whole Rust tree (tens of seconds warm,
#   minutes cold) and this runs in the routine test sweep. The proxy is exact
#   about what it does check: src/python/LICENSE exists as a regular file and is
#   byte-identical to the root LICENSE, and pyproject declares a PEP-639
#   `license-files` glob that matches it. Pass `--with-wheel` (CI / release
#   preflight) to replace the proxy with a REAL `maturin build` + a read of the
#   built wheel's `.dist-info/licenses/` and METADATA. Measured 2026-07-29 with
#   `--with-wheel`: `fathomdb-0.8.9.dist-info/licenses/LICENSE`, byte-identical,
#   `Metadata-Version: 2.4`, `License-Expression: MIT`.
#
# TWO MEASURED FACTS THE PREDICATE ENCODES (both were surprises; both are the
# reason the assertions look the way they do):
#
#   * npm SILENTLY IGNORES A LICENSE SYMLINK. `src/ts/LICENSE -> ../../LICENSE`
#     produced a tarball with NO license entry at all (npm pack, npm 10.x).
#     A REAL COPY is auto-included even though `files` is `["dist", ...]`.
#     So the npm and Python legs require a REGULAR FILE and assert byte-equality
#     with the root LICENSE — the copy is the drift risk, byte-equality is the
#     mitigation.
#   * CARGO'S SPDX METADATA AND LICENSE TEXT ARE SEPARATE. Cargo warns when a
#     package declares both `license` and `license-file`. MIT is a standard
#     SPDX expression, so every publishable crate inherits `license = "MIT"`
#     only and carries a regular package-root `LICENSE` copy. Cargo includes
#     that conventional file in the `.crate`; byte equality prevents drift.
#
# VACUOUS-PASS GUARD (this repo's named failure class, TC-37): every "cannot
# determine" path exits 2, never 0. Missing LICENSE, unrecognised license type,
# absent cargo/npm/python3, a workspace member whose manifest will not parse —
# all are environment/gate failures reported LOUDLY. A gate that cannot see its
# subject and reports green is an active false assurance.

# Usage:
#   scripts/check-license-consistency.sh [--root <dir>] [--only <legs>]

#
#   --root <dir>       tree to check (default: git toplevel). Exists so the
#                      fixture tests can point at throwaway COPIES; the real
#                      manifests are never written by a test.
#   --only <legs>      comma list from {cargo,python,npm}. Default: all three.
#                      An ecosystem is never skipped IMPLICITLY — a missing
#                      manifest in a selected leg is a failure, not a skip.
#   --skip-packaging   run half (i) only. For fixture arms that mutate
#                      declarations and do not need the packaging tools.
#   --with-wheel       replace the wheel MECHANISM PROXY with a real
#                      `maturin build` of src/python (slow; needs maturin).
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every selected assertion holds
#             1 = a real divergence (wrong type, missing/duplicated license
#                 text, or a packaging tool that did not list a license file)
#             2 = usage error, or the gate could not run (missing tool,
#                 unparseable manifest, undeterminable license type) — NEVER
#                 reported as a pass
