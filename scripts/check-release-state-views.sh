# scripts/check-release-state-views.sh — T2a enforcement (DOC-HYGIENE-2):
# SINGLE-WRITER RELEASE STATE + GENERATED VIEWS.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY (measured, not hypothetical)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 0.8.20's release state — which slices have landed and at which SHAs, the
# SCHEMA version, which slice is next, the AC status, which decisions are ruled
# — was narrated across a 5-12 file write-side fan-out, and NOTHING checked that
# the copies agreed. One reconciliation commit (b70629e5) had to touch SEVEN
# files to bring them back into line, and the live board is ~79 KB: nobody reads
# it whole, so a copy can sit wrong for weeks without anyone noticing.
#
# The remedy is the standing rule's remedy — fix the tooling so it cannot recur
# for anyone, rather than writing a "remember to update all seven" note:
#
#   * ONE machine-readable state file per live release owns the facts:
#     dev/plans/release-state-<version>.json.
#   * Restatements of those facts in prose become MARKER-DELIMITED GENERATED
#     REGIONS, rendered from that file.
#   * This gate regenerates every region into a temp buffer and DIFFS it against
#     what is actually in the document. Any difference is a hard failure — so a
#     hand-edit of a view goes red, and a fact changed in the state file without
#     a regenerate goes red too.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IT ENFORCES (four rules + one guard)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RULE 1 — REGENERATE-AND-DIFF. For every view a state file declares, the bytes
#   between its BEGIN and END markers must equal the bytes the renderer produces
#   from that state file. Not a heuristic, not a wording check: byte equality.
#
# RULE 2 — MARKERS MUST BE WELL-FORMED AND PRESENT. A declared view whose BEGIN
#   or END marker is missing, duplicated, or out of order is a FAILURE, never a
#   skip. A view that silently stops being checked is worse than no view.
#
# RULE 3 — NO ORPHAN MARKERS (the confinement rule). Every
#   `BEGIN GENERATED release-state:` marker anywhere in the worktree's markdown
#   must belong to a view some state file declares. This is what mechanically
#   holds the HITL pre-sign's "generated regions are confined to exactly the
#   named locations, nothing else": a marker added anywhere else fails.
#
# RULE 4 — EVERY DECLARED VIEW MUST HAVE A RENDERER. A view id this script does
#   not know how to render cannot be checked, so it is a failure rather than a
#   silently-unchecked region.
#
# VACUOUS-PASS GUARD (TC-37 — this repo's named failure class: a gate that
#   reports green without having run). If ZERO state files are discovered, or
#   ZERO generated blocks are checked, the checking loop never executes and this
#   script would exit 0 having vouched for nothing. Both are HARD failures.
#   This is the same hole that let a genuinely-red `main` read green for three
#   weeks when markdownlint-cli2 was absent.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS *NOT* GENERATED (deliberate, and load-bearing)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The three fenced regions are SUB-REGIONS of their locations, not whole
# sections. The surrounding prose — narrative, rationale, cross-references,
# history — stays hand-written and OUTSIDE the markers, untouched. A renderer
# cannot plausibly re-derive judgement prose, and pretending otherwise would
# mean laundering that prose through a JSON string, which buys nothing. Only
# mechanically-derivable fact restatements are fenced. Removing the marker
# comments restores the documents exactly, byte for byte: the fencing is fully
# reversible and deletes nothing.
#

# Remote-landing guard.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `render_master_ladder_progress` and
# `render_plan_landed_roll_up` both emit the literal words "LANDED on
# `origin/main`", but every fact they render comes from the state file's
# `landed` array. Neither ever asked Git whether those SHAs are reachable from
# the remote, so a slice was declared REMOTELY landed the instant it was
# written to the state file — which is local-commit time. On 2026-08-03 local
# `main` sat 21 commits ahead of `origin/main` with three of 0.8.21's five
# slices (0, 15, 20) unpushed, while the plan asserted all five were on
# `origin/main` in full. The board could not have caught it: it was
# structurally incapable of reporting the gap it was asserting away.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE CHECK AND NOT A RENDER CHANGE. This script's contract
# is that committed Markdown equals generated Markdown. If the rendered STRING
# varied with local push state, the generated text would differ between a
# steward's checkout and CI, and every in-flight slice would report a spurious
# view mismatch. So the render stays deterministic over the state file and the
# push fact is verified alongside it.
#
# WHY IT IS ADVISORY OFF `main`. A PR branch legitimately carries a landed SHA
# that is not yet on `origin/main` — that is what the PR is for. Hard-failing
# there would block the very merge that resolves it. On `main`, the same
# condition is exactly the drift above and is a HARD failure.

    THE MEASURED FAILURE. That pointer was HAND-WRITTEN while this file already
    owned `next_slice` and already kept it true at every landing, and it went
    stale at THREE CONSECUTIVE COMMISSIONS — twice inside one session. At the
    Slice 21 commission it still read "Slice 30" although Slice 30 had landed at
    9b3ed0e3; it was fixed at 62486a01 only because the Steward happened to read
    the anchor the manifest cited. Hours later, right after Slice 21 landed, it
    read "Slice 21".

    WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN ORDINARY DOC ROT. `scripts/commission-manifest.sh`
    resolves `## 9. Immediate next slice` as the `{{MANDATE}}` anchor of an
    orchestrator brief, and its CHECK 2 verifies that the HEADING EXISTS — not
    that the prose beneath it is current. A heading cannot rot; the prose under
    it does. So a generated, path-verified brief handed an orchestrator a
    hand-written pointer at the wrong slice, with the manifest's authority behind
    it, and the staleness was COPIED INTO THE NEXT COMMISSION. The mitigation
    that used to sit above it — a blockquote telling the reader to re-verify
    against `next_slice` — is a NOTE, not a control; this renderer is the control.

    THE FACTS, all three already owned here and all three already updated at
    every landing: `next_slice`, that slice's ladder entry (`short` + `title`),
    and `remaining_ladder`. Nothing is inferred and no prose is laundered through
    the JSON — the surrounding §9 narrative (deliverables, guardrails, the
    historical roll-up) stays hand-written and OUTSIDE the markers, exactly as
    the other four views leave their surroundings alone.

    IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES. `next_slice: null` is a real end-of-release
    state, and a renderer that emitted "Slice None" would put a FABRICATED
    pointer in front of the next orchestrator with this gate's authority behind
    it — the same failure this view exists to close, wearing a different hat. So
    a non-integer `next_slice`, or one naming a slice the ladder does not carry,
    raises with the reason and the gate reports it (arm 10e).

    The leading newline is load-bearing for the same CommonMark reason
