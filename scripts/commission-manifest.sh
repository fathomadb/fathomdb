# scripts/commission-manifest.sh — T3b (DOC-HYGIENE-2): the GENERATED COMMISSION
# MANIFEST. Given a release and a slice, emit the citation list an orchestrator
# brief needs — design-of-record paths, contract paths, plan section anchors, the
# base SHA, the worktree rules and the stop conditions — and HARD-FAIL if any of
# it has rotted.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY (measured, not hypothetical)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Commissioning a slice meant hand-assembling the same list every time out of a
# 5-12 file fan-out (the master, the plan, the STATUS board, the hand-off, the
# ledgers, the design tier), and NOTHING checked that the paths it cited still
# resolved. T1d measured what that costs on the anchor axis: the TC-45 pointers
# in `dev/plans/plan-0.8.20.md` were ~2,100 lines off and, per `git log`, had
# never been correct. A citation nobody checks rots silently.
#
# THIS REPLACES A HAND-MAINTAINED BRIEF TEMPLATE; it does not add one. That shape
# already exists twice in-repo, and the section set emitted below is DERIVED from
# what those two documents actually contain, so the generated manifest is a real
# substitute rather than a parallel invention:
#   * dev/plans/prompts/LIBRARY-BUMP-ORCHESTRATOR-TEMPLATE.md — Assignment
#     (branch-from tip, worktree path, coupling), STEP 0 Isolate, Escalate-to-LBS,
#     Closure output.
#   * dev/plans/prompts/0.8.0-SLICE-TEMPLATE.md — {{CONTRACT_REF}}, {{READING}},
#     {{MANDATE}}, {{DEFERRED}}, {{AC_IDS}}, {{GUARDRAILS}}, {{DOD}}, §6 scope
#     discipline, §7 recovery, §9 closure schema.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHERE THE FACTS COME FROM (it re-scrapes nothing that already has an owner)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * dev/plans/release-state-<release>.json (T2a) is the SINGLE WRITER for the
#     ladder, the landed slices + their landing SHAs, the SCHEMA version, the
#     next slice, the AC state and the ruled/unruled decision set. Every one of
#     those facts below is read from it — never re-derived from prose. Change a
#     fact THERE and the manifest follows.
#   * `status:` frontmatter on dev/design/**/*.md (T2c) selects the design tier,
#     so the design-of-record list is derived, not a hardcoded list.
#   * The plan's own `##` headings supply the section anchors, looked up by ROLE
#     keyword rather than by line number (T1d's ban) or by a frozen title string.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE DESIGN TIER HAS TWO HALVES: DISCOVERY, AND CITATION (`design_refs`)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The discovery half is the pair of selectors in scan_design(): a doc whose
# FILENAME names this release AND this slice, and a doc whose CONTENT mentions a
# token derived from the ladder entry's own `short`/`title`. Both are measured,
# and both MISS AN ENTIRE CLASS OF SLICE BY CONSTRUCTION:
#   * The filename selector hit 1 of the 12 slices in the 0.8.20 ladder.
#   * `plan-<release>.md` §3 is "frozen at Slice 0", so a RESERVED-GAP slice
#     minted mid-release by HITL ruling has requirement ids (R-20-CR, R-20-VC,
#     R-20-SV and their TC-* carries) that appear NOWHERE under dev/design/ —
#     the design package predates them — and it never got a §3.0 memo of its
#     own either.
# The TC-37 vacuous-pass guard therefore hard-failed on three well-designed
# slices in a row: 21, 22 and 23 (tracked as TC-92 and TC-94).
#
# `design_refs` on a ladder entry is the CITATION half. The Steward names the
# docs; nothing is inferred. Four properties are deliberate:
#   1. OPTIONAL AND INERT. No key ⇒ byte-for-byte the behaviour that predates
#      it. It adds a tier; it does not reinterpret the existing one.
#   2. CHECKED LIKE EVERY OTHER PATH. A curated citation carries the Steward's
#      authority, so a dead one misleads MORE than a dead scan hit, not less:
#      CHECK 1 applies with no exemption and the manifest is not emitted.
#   3. IT REACHES ANYTHING IN THE CHECKOUT, including tiers the walker does not
#      cover. (When this was written the walker covered `dev/design/` alone and
#      this was the ONLY route to `dev/adr/**` and `dev/interfaces/**`; TC-94
#      defect 1 has since put those two tiers inside the scan — see
#      DESIGN_ROOTS — so curation is no longer the only way to reach them. It is
#      still the only way to reach anything else, and it is still the only way to
#      put a BYTE-PINNED contract in front of an orchestrator, since a pinned
#      file can never be back-linked.) Curated docs often carry no `status:`
#      frontmatter at all, and the row then SAYS there is none rather than
#      inventing one, exactly as the UNREVIEWED rows refuse to launder.
#   4. IT IS NEVER BLENDED WITH THE SCAN. Curated rows are labelled CURATED and
#      kept in their own block, so a reader can always tell a doc somebody chose
#      from a doc a substring match found.
# It does NOT weaken the guard: an empty/absent `design_refs` AND an empty scan
# is still a hard failure.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW UNREVIEWED IS HANDLED (deliberate, and the honest part)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# T2c's backfill was conservative on purpose: most design docs are UNREVIEWED,
# which means "nobody has classified this yet" — NOT "this is current" — and
# scripts/lint-design-status.sh proves the PRESENCE of a status field, never its
# TRUTH (the classification is a separate owed slice, TC-50). So this manifest
# NEVER presents an UNREVIEWED doc as authoritative: each cited doc carries its
# recorded status inline, UNREVIEWED/UNKNOWN rows are explicitly marked
# unclassified with the TC-50 pointer, and the section header says the status is
# recorded rather than verified. The reader judges; the generator does not
# launder.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IT ENFORCES (two hard checks + one guard)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHECK 1 — EVERY CITED PATH MUST EXIST. Always on, not a `--verify` extra. A
#   path that does not resolve is a HARD failure and the manifest is NOT emitted:
#   printing a brief with one dead citation in it is the artifact this replaces.
# CHECK 2 — EVERY CITED ANCHOR MUST OCCUR. Anchors are greppable section
#   headings/symbols, never `file:line` (T1d RULE 1), and each is verified by
#   literal match inside the file it names (T1d RULE 2). Swapping an unverified
#   NUMBER for an unverified SYMBOL would just launder a bad pointer.
# CHECK 3 — THE BASE SHA IS THE TARGET SLICE'S PREDECESSOR, never `max(landed)`.
#   For any slice that is not the next one, the newest landed slice can BE the
#   target (or later), and a manifest that says "branch from here" while naming
#   the target's own merge is the agent-worktree-stale-base trap in printed
#   form. §2 takes the greatest landed slice STRICTLY BELOW the target, marks a
#   regeneration of an already-landed slice as HISTORICAL, and says plainly
#   when no predecessor exists rather than emitting a blank or a wrong SHA.
# GUARD — TC-37 VACUOUS PASS (this repo's named failure class). Zero design
#   citations for the slice, zero citations overall, zero paths verified, or a
#   sweep that discovers zero state files: all HARD failures. A manifest that is
#   empty has briefed nobody while looking green.
#
# READ-ONLY: emits to stdout, writes no file into the repo. It records state and
# cites decisions; it changes no slot, scope, requirement, AC or ruling.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/commission-manifest.sh <release> <slice|next> [--verify]
#   scripts/commission-manifest.sh --verify-all
# Exit: 0 = manifest emitted (or verified) with every path and anchor resolving;

# THE ROOTS THE DISCOVERY SCAN WALKS. Exactly three, and the list is a bound, not

#
# It used to be `dev/design` alone, which made `dev/adr/**` and
# `dev/interfaces/**` unreachable BY CONSTRUCTION, at any status, no matter what
# was back-linked into them. That excluded precisely the strongest evidence: an
# ADR is a HIGHER tier of authority than a design memo
# (`ADR-0.6.0-error-taxonomy.md` is the ruling document for decision #18;
# `ADR-0.8.18-vector-equivalence-self-check.md` is HITL-SIGNED), and
# `dev/interfaces/*.md` is the surface AGENTS.md obliges an error-surface change
# to update — an obligation TC-39 already records as routinely missed.
#
# WHY NOT WIDER. Walking all of `dev/` would drag planning notes, run artifacts
# and hand-off memos into every brief; `dev/plans/**` alone is larger than the
# design tier and is narrative, not authority. The three roots below are the tiers
# that CARRY design authority, and the bound is asserted (test arm 12c3).
#

# under substring matching would have multiplied TC-100's spurious hits across
# three times as many documents. The two changes ship together for that reason.

    Existence is NOT checked here: it is checked by CHECK 1 over the emitted

    the failure this whole manifest exists to prevent (see §8: "Ruled decisions

      1. `pre_sign_state` — has the HITL signed off on the CONTENT of the delta?
