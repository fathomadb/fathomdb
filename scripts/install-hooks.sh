# Activate the repo-tracked git hooks (scripts/hooks/*) for THIS clone by
# pointing git's core.hooksPath at them. Idempotent.
#
#   scripts/install-hooks.sh    # activate / refresh tracked-hook activation
#
# WHY core.hooksPath instead of symlinking into .git/hooks:
#   * Zero "remember to run it": once bootstrap.sh sets this, every actor in
#     this clone runs the tracked pre-commit (md auto-fix/enforce, fmt, ruff),
#     advisory commit-msg warning, and pre-push automatically — there is no
#     per-file adoption decision that could silently leave a stale legacy hook
#     in place (the failure mode that left the markdown guard dormant in every
#     checkout).
#   * Worktrees: core.hooksPath lives in the SHARED common config (.git/config),
#     so linked worktrees inherit it; the value is REPO-RELATIVE (scripts/hooks),
#     which git resolves against each worktree's own root — so a linked worktree
#     activates its own tracked hooks instead of silently having none.
#
# Velocity note: the tracked pre-push is FAST by default (clippy + actionlint);
# the heavy full-verify gate is opt-in via FATHOMDB_PREPUSH_FULL=1. So enabling
# core.hooksPath does NOT make every push slow. See scripts/hooks/pre-push.
