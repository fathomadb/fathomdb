# scripts/lint-design-status.sh — T2c enforcement (DOC-HYGIENE-2).
#
# Sibling of scripts/lint-plans-status.sh, for the OTHER governed doc tier.
# `dev/design/**` is the largest doc surface in the repo (~108 .md / ~1.9 MB at
# the time this landed) and it is the tier a Steward must cite to an
# orchestrator — yet nothing linted it: lint-plans-status.sh is scoped to
# `dev/plans/*.md` TOP-LEVEL ONLY (see its § "Scope") and never reached here.
# 62 of those 108 docs carried no `status:` at all, so "which design docs are
# still current?" could only be answered by reading all of them.
#
# The rule: every `dev/design/**/*.md` (RECURSIVE — subdirectories such as
# record-lifecycle-protocol/ and fathomdb-memex-overall-roadmap/ are in scope)
# must carry YAML frontmatter with a `status:` key. A doc whose status is
# SUPERSEDED must additionally carry a `superseded_by:` pointing somewhere — a
# supersession that names no successor is a dead end for the next reader.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE (HITL 2026-07-25, todos TC-50):
# it proves the PRESENCE of a status field, never its TRUTH. The backfill that
# accompanied it deliberately defaulted to UNREVIEWED, because a doc wrongly
# marked ACTIVE is worse than one with no marker. The real classification is a
# separate owed slice (TC-50). Do not read a green run here as "the statuses
# are correct".
#
# UNREVIEWED vs UNKNOWN — near-synonyms, kept distinct on purpose:
#   UNKNOWN    (inherited from lint-plans-status.sh) = someone LOOKED and the
#              true status genuinely could not be sourced from the master's §4
#              allocation table or the doc's own banners. An honest dead end.
#   UNREVIEWED (added here) = nobody has classified this doc yet. The TC-50
#              backfill default. It is a queue marker, not a verdict.
# A doc moving UNREVIEWED -> UNKNOWN is progress (it was examined); the reverse
# is not. Flagged to the Steward as a candidate for consolidation once TC-50
# has drained the UNREVIEWED backlog.
#
# LEGACY STATUS VALUES (frozen inventory, monotone ratchet):
# 43 design docs predate this gate with free-form values — `locked` (the 0.8.0
# architecture specs), `accepted`, `decision-ready`, `SIGNED (...)`, `PROPOSAL —
# awaiting HITL review (...)` and so on. None of them fit the governed
# vocabulary. Rewriting them here would BE the TC-50 classification this tranche
# is explicitly forbidden to attempt, and would destroy real signal, so they are
# grandfathered by VALUE (leading token, case-insensitive), not by filename:
# lint-plans-status.sh's own header records why a filename carve-out is "exactly
# the shape of gate that rots", and that reasoning applies here too — the rule
# below is total and name-blind.
# The grandfathering is bounded by a ratchet: LEGACY_BUDGET is a CEILING that
# must never rise. A new doc using a legacy value pushes the count over the
# ceiling and fails. As TC-50 retires legacy values the count drops BELOW the
# ceiling — and that fails too, naming the new number, so the budget must be
# lowered in the same change that lowered the count. The count and the ceiling
# are therefore always equal, and both can only ever fall.
#
# Zero-discovery hard fail (TC-37, this repo's named vacuous-pass class): if the
# scan finds NO files it fails loudly rather than exiting 0. A gate that silently
# passes because its scope evaporated (a moved directory, a broken glob) is the
# exact failure mode TC-37 is named for.
#
# Scope: dev/design/**/*.md ONLY. Nothing outside dev/design/ is read.
#
# Pass: silent, exit 0. Fail: one line per offending file + nonzero exit.
