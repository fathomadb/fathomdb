# preflight.sh — release/worktree gate, run before starting dependent work.
#
# Codifies the checks whose absence has cost real slices:
#   * agent-worktree-stale-base-trap — a worktree cut from a stale base (main had
#     advanced ~206 commits) silently lost two slices. The --worktree check below
#     fails loudly when a worktree does not descend from the active release-state
#     baseline.
#   * dependency-not-actually-CLOSED — starting a slice whose exact release-state
#     ladder dependency is open, missing, duplicated, or not Git-reachable.
#   * landing-in-the-primary-checkout — TC-RUBRIC-5 requires release orchestration
#     and all landing git-writes to run in a dedicated linked worktree. --landing
#     HARD-fails when invoked from the primary checkout.
#
# Witness-first (orchestration.md §1.5): every check derives from the repo on disk,
# never from belief. Emits a one-line JSON summary; exits non-zero on any HARD fail.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/preflight.sh                              # general repo health (run anytime)
#   scripts/preflight.sh --worktree /tmp/fdb-slice-5-... # + stale-base guard on a freshly cut WT
#   scripts/preflight.sh --expect-closed 5 --plan dev/plans/plan-0.8.6.md

#   scripts/preflight.sh --worktree <wt> --expect-closed 5 --plan <plan> --min-disk-gb 15
#
# --landing composes with every other flag and is inert unless passed: without it
# the script behaves exactly as it did before the flag existed.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = all HARD checks pass (WARN/INFO may print); 1 = a HARD check failed.
