# preflight.sh — orchestrator-side gate, run BEFORE spawning an implementer.
#
# Codifies the checks whose absence has cost real slices:
#   * agent-worktree-stale-base-trap — a worktree cut from a stale base (main had
#     advanced ~206 commits) silently lost two slices. The --worktree check below
#     fails loudly when a worktree's HEAD is neither its declared 0.8.23 release
#     completion ref nor current main (or a descendant of the applicable ref).
#   * dependency-not-actually-CLOSED — spawning a slice whose declared dependency
#     never closed. The --expect-closed check greps the plan for the CLOSED block.
#   * landing-in-the-primary-checkout — TC-RUBRIC-5 requires release orchestration
#     and all landing git-writes to run in a dedicated linked worktree. --landing
#     HARD-fails when invoked from the primary checkout.
#
# Witness-first (orchestration.md §1.5): every check derives from the repo on disk,
# never from belief. Emits a one-line JSON summary; exits non-zero on any HARD fail.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/preflight.sh                              # general repo health (run anytime)
#   scripts/preflight.sh --worktree /tmp/fdb-slice-5-... # + stale-base guard on a freshly cut WT

#   scripts/preflight.sh --worktree <wt> --expect-closed 5 --plan <plan> --min-disk-gb 15
#
# --landing composes with every other flag and is inert unless passed: without it

# --- 5. Dependency-CLOSED gate ---------------------------------------------------
# SLICE-ID-HARDENING site 4 + [DETERMINE] duty 1. This gate's entire stated
# purpose is catching a dependency that is not actually closed, and it had TWO
# INDEPENDENT ways of saying yes anyway. Both were measured by executing the real
# grep, not reasoned about, and NEITHER fix subsumes the other:
#
#   (a) The interpolated value was UNESCAPED, so with `--expect-closed 39.5` the
#       `.` was a regex WILDCARD: a plan line reading `Slice 39x5 ... CLOSED`
#       cleared the gate. Escaping is REQUIRED. (Measured: escaping alone still
#       leaves (b) wide open.)
#   (b) The trailing `[^0-9]` matched the `.` in `Slice 39.5`, so ONE UNIT'S
#       CLOSED WITNESS SATISFIED ANOTHER'S: `--expect-closed 39` was cleared by a
#       plan in which only Slice 39.5 ever closed. A boundary tighten is
#       REQUIRED. (Measured: tightening alone still leaves (a) wide open.)
#
# The boundary is `([^0-9.]|\.[^0-9])`, NOT the obvious `[^0-9.]`. Measured: the
# bare `[^0-9.]` closes (b) but introduces a NEW FALSE NEGATIVE — a legitimate
# sentence-final `CLOSED - Slice 39.` stops matching, and this gate's failure
# mode is refusing to spawn. What must be rejected is a following DIGIT or a
# following `.`+DIGIT (i.e. a longer dotted id); a `.` followed by anything else
# is just punctuation. ERE has no lookahead, so it is spelled out. The second
# alternative additionally carries `\.?$` because it, unlike the first, can end
# at end-of-line (the two alternatives are NOT symmetric).
#
# Real-state effect, measured across every dev/plans/*.md for slice ids 0-60:
# exactly ONE behaviour delta, and it is a FALSE POSITIVE REMOVED —
# 0.7.0-implementation.md:456 `(Phase 0.7.0 GA CLOSED, ...)` was satisfying
# `--expect-closed 0`, the version dot being read as a boundary. That is site 4's
# own defect class, live in a tracked file.
#
# A dependency can also be LANDED, or (for the scoped 0.8.23 release branch)
# COMPLETED before integration into main. The release-state renderer writes its
# canonical roll-up as `<closure> on <verified ref>: Slices <id> ...`; rejecting
# that generated record would make an already-complete prerequisite appear open.
# Keep the same exact-id boundary for all affirmative closure states and for singular and
# plural Slice labels: a neighbouring fractional id must never clear this gate.
# A closure state must also be a standalone affirmative token. `NOT CLOSED` is
# not closure, and neither are prefixed words such as `UNCLOSED` or `UNLANDED`.
# Filter a line carrying a negated state before searching it: a line that says
# both states is contradictory, not evidence that it is safe to spawn.

# --- 11. TC-86 transcript-hygiene gate -------------------------------------------
# Refuse to land a tree in which any TRACKED file carries a home-anchored path
# into a user's Claude Code state directory — i.e. raw agent SESSION TRANSCRIPT
# content. github.com/coreyt/fathomdb is PUBLIC, so landing such a line publishes
# another project's conversation.
#
# This is not hypothetical. On 2026-07-28 a codex §9 review transcript arrived
# carrying 216 lines of raw session JSONL from three OTHER projects: codex runs
# under --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox (which is what lets it read
# outside the repo), it `rg`'d across ~/.claude, and TC-RUBRIC-7 then required
# its stdout be persisted under a tracked path. Caught and redacted before
# landing; `git grep` proved reachability in history is ZERO. TC-86, steward
# `seq-129`, todos `TC-86`, master `F-36`.
#
# The predicate lives in scripts/check-transcript-hygiene.sh — see that file's
# header for the pattern's discriminators and, just as importantly, for what it
# deliberately does NOT claim to check (it is not a secrets scanner). preflight
# and the always-on CI job share ONE implementation and cannot diverge, exactly
# as §7–§10 do. --landing-only, mirroring their structure: the CI job —
# deliberately NOT docs_only-gated — covers every non-landing push, and is the
# load-bearing home because a pre-commit hook is bypassable with --no-verify.
#
# Tripping this is CORRECT BEHAVIOUR. The fix is `scripts/check-transcript-hygiene.sh
# --redact`, which rewrites the offending lines IN PLACE behind a banner and
# never deletes the transcript (TC-RUBRIC-7 closes a review on a persisted
# artifact). Do NOT weaken the pattern to clear a land — route that to the
# Steward.
