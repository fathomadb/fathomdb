"""Resolve the one tracked, active FathomDB release.

The release state is deliberately derived from tracked state/board pairs, never
from a worktree scan: linked worktrees and untracked scratch documents must not
change the release of record.  On success stdout is a tab-separated
``release, board, state`` tuple, suitable for small shell consumers. When every
tracked release is published, success has empty stdout: the schedule is valid
but has no active release to commission.
