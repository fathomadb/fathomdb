#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/release/cargo-publish-if-new.sh — idempotency guard for the
# release.yml T1..T7 cargo-publish tiers.
#
# Reads the local crate version from src/rust/crates/<crate>/Cargo.toml
# (resolving `version.workspace = true` to the root [workspace.package]),
# queries crates.io for already-published versions, and:
#
#   • if the target version is already on the registry → log
#     "already published; skipping" and exit 0 (idempotent no-op).
#   • otherwise → invoke `cargo publish -p <crate> --token "$CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN"`.
#
# With --dry-run, the registry check is bypassed. The three leaf crates forward
# to `cargo publish --dry-run -p <crate>`; the four dependency-bearing crates
# explicitly skip that command because their rewritten sibling dependencies
# cannot resolve until the real preceding tiers reach the registry.
#
# Motivation: axis-W-only patch releases (e.g. 0.6.1, where axis-E
# fathomdb-embedder-api is held at 0.6.0) would otherwise fail at T1
# with "version already exists". Also covers partial-republish retries
# where an RC2 follows an RC1 that landed only some tiers.
#
# Registry-safety (Fix-2): the version QUERY honours
# CARGO_PUBLISH_IF_NEW_REGISTRY, but `cargo publish` has no URL knob and always
# targets prod crates.io from ambient config. So a staging/test run whose query
# was redirected to a non-prod index could still PUBLISH to the real crates.io —
# the exact split-brain hole closed for npm (--registry) and PyPI
# (--repository-url). Rule, mirroring that posture:
#   • query NOT overridden (real release)         → publish to crates.io (unchanged);
#   • query overridden + publish-registry mapped   → cargo publish --registry <name>
#     (a [registries] alt configured to the same staging host);
#   • query overridden + NO publish-registry map   → FAIL CLOSED (loud, non-zero).
#     Never silently publish to prod when the query was redirected.
#
# Test env overrides (NOT for production CI):
#   CARGO_PUBLISH_IF_NEW_REGISTRY         — base URL in place of https://crates.io
#                                           (redirects the version QUERY only)
#   CARGO_PUBLISH_IF_NEW_PUBLISH_REGISTRY — cargo alt-registry NAME (a configured
#                                           [registries] entry / CARGO_REGISTRIES_
#                                           <NAME>_INDEX) to route the PUBLISH to,
#                                           so query and publish hit the same host
#   CARGO_PUBLISH_IF_NEW_LOCAL_VERSION    — skip manifest read; use this version

Usage: cargo-publish-if-new.sh [--dry-run] <crate-name>

Publishes <crate-name> to crates.io only if the local Cargo.toml
version is not already on the registry.

With --dry-run, leaf crates (`fathomdb-embedder-api`, `fathomdb-schema`,
and `fathomdb-query`) run `cargo publish --dry-run`. Dependent crates
(`fathomdb-embedder`, `fathomdb-engine`, `fathomdb`, `fathomdb-sdk`, and `fathomdb-cli`)
are skipped without invoking cargo because their sibling dependencies cannot
resolve until preceding real tiers reach the registry.

Environment:
  CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN  required when not in --dry-run mode
