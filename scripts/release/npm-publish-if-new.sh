# scripts/release/npm-publish-if-new.sh — idempotent npm publish guard for the
# release.yml tier-8 npm legs (main package + per-platform packages).
#
# npm rejects a second `publish` of an already-published version with E403,
# which turns any partial-release retry (or the coordinated 0.8.20 OPP-12
# breaking-pair re-run) into a hard failure. This wrapper makes the npm leg
# idempotent — matching the crates.io behaviour of cargo-publish-if-new.sh:
#
#   • query the npm registry for <name>@<version>;
#   • if that exact version already exists  → log + exit 0 (no-op);
#   • otherwise                             → `npm publish` with the given args.
#
# Usage:
#   npm-publish-if-new.sh [--dry-run] --tag <dist-tag> [-- <extra npm args>]
#
# Reads name+version from ./package.json in the current working directory
# (so it works uniformly for the main package and each npm/<target>/ package).
#
# Env:
#   NPM_PUBLISH_IF_NEW_REGISTRY  base URL in place of https://registry.npmjs.org
#                                (tests point this at a fixture http server)
#   NPM_BIN                      publish command to invoke (default: npm; may be
#                                a multi-word command, e.g. "npx npm@latest",
#                                which CI needs for OIDC trusted publishing;
#                                tests shim a single-word `npm`)
#
# Exit: 0 = published or already-present (idempotent); non-zero = real failure.

Usage: npm-publish-if-new.sh [--dry-run] --tag <dist-tag> [-- <extra npm publish args>]

Publishes ./package.json's name@version to npm only if that version is not
already on the registry. --dry-run forwards to `npm publish --dry-run` when
the version is absent. For an already-published version it instead runs
`npm pack --dry-run`, which rehearses package construction without asking npm
to overwrite an immutable version.
