#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/steward-orient.sh — the stateless cold-start briefing (DOC-HYGIENE-2 T3a).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every Steward cold start re-paid for the same orientation:
# which branch/HEAD, what is landed, what SCHEMA, what is next, what the ledgers
# say, what is in flight. That state was narrated across a 5-12 file fan-out and
# the live board alone is ~79 KB, so orientation cost either a large context bill
# or a guess. This prints the whole picture in ONE read, from the writers of
# record, in under 4 KB.
#
# ============================ THE TWO HARD LIMITS ============================
# 1. <= 4096 bytes on stdout. Self-checked: over budget is a HARD failure, not a
#    silent overrun, because the cap is a promise to the reader's context budget.
#    Override for experiments only via $STEWARD_ORIENT_BUDGET.
#    Collections are cardinality-bounded: worktrees retain actionable identity
#    for the current checkout and one locked and detached exception (each
#    path/branch/SHA), then state exact omitted-row counts plus `git worktree
#    list` for full follow-up; ledger preview is five headline-first entries; and
#    todo IDs are losslessly run-folded. THE STANDING EXPOSURE is the board's
#    next-action cell: it is verbatim by contract and its length is set by its
#    writer. Keep §1's next action short; do not raise the cap or truncate the
#    cell — the suite asserts both the cap and verbatim reproduction independently.
# 2. WRITES NOTHING. No repo file, no ledger, no cursor, no commit. The only
#    filesystem touch is one mktemp -d sandbox, removed by an EXIT trap, used as
#    an ephemeral ledgerwatch --state-dir so the Steward's REAL cursor is never
#    read or advanced. Verified mechanically by scripts/tests/test_steward_orient.sh
#    (fixture tree byte-identical before/after; the run's whole TMPDIR empty after).
#    ".git/index" IS A FILE THIS SCRIPT WRITES TOO, and it is the one the working
#    tree's own contract lives in. `git status` REFRESHES a stale stat cache and
#    then rewrites the index under .git/index.lock — measured on git 2.43:
#    touching tracked files and running `git status --porcelain` changes the
#    index's bytes. That is a repo-metadata write in a script whose whole promise
#    is that it makes none, it can race a concurrent git command for the index
#    lock, and it would fail in a read-only checkout. So EVERY git probe here runs
#    with git's OPTIONAL locks disabled (GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0 plus an explicit
#    --no-optional-locks at each call site): git then does all the same reads and
#    simply declines to persist the refreshed cache. The env var covers git run by
#    CHILD processes (gh, python3); the per-call flag keeps the intent legible and
#    survives someone unsetting the environment. Asserted by the suite's
#    ".git/index is byte-unchanged across a run with a deliberately staled stat
#    cache" arm, plus a structural arm that no bare `git` call creeps back in.
#
# ========================== WHERE THE FACTS COME FROM ========================
# LIVE repo facts are read live (branch, HEAD, dirty count, bounded actionable
# worktrees plus explicit full-list follow-up, orphan checkout dirs, open-PR
# count). RELEASE facts are NOT re-scraped from git: they
# are read from `dev/plans/release-state-<version>.json`, the single writer that
# DOC-HYGIENE-2 T2a landed for landed-slices+SHAs, SCHEMA, and the next slice
# (kept honest against its rendered views by scripts/check-release-state-views.sh).
# Re-scraping them here would recreate the exact fan-out this effort removes.
#
# ======================= FOUR THINGS THAT ARE LOAD-BEARING ==================
# (1) THE RELEASE COMES FROM scripts/release-current.py. It validates the tracked
#     release-state/board pairs and returns exactly one non-CLOSED board. A
#     hardcoded version, a highest-version tie-break, or an untracked nested
#     worktree copy would all recreate the ambiguity this briefing exists to end.
# (2) `<repo-root>-worktrees/` IS A SIBLING OF THE REPO ROOT, NOT A CHILD. It is
#     resolved from the MAIN worktree's root (via --git-common-dir, so running
#     this from inside a linked worktree still resolves the same sibling) plus a
#     `-worktrees` suffix. Resolving it as a child yields a silently empty
#     section, which is precisely the failure mode this briefing exists to end.
# (3) ANY ZERO-RESULT SECTION IS A HARD FAILURE. A briefing that silently omits a
#     section is worse than no briefing: the reader cannot tell "nothing to
#     report" from "I could not read it". The payload still prints (it is useful
#     even when partial), then the run names every empty section on stderr and
#     exits 1.
#     DOCUMENTED EXEMPTIONS — sections with a legitimate empty state, each an
#     explicit decision on the record rather than an accident:
#       * open-PR count: zero open PRs is a real, healthy state. `gh` being
#         absent or unauthenticated prints an explicit `unavailable (<reason>)`
#         marker instead — a cold start must not fail because the operator is
#         offline, but it must also never quietly show a wrong number.
#       * orphan checkout dirs: zero orphans is the HEALTHY state. Prints
#         `(none)` alongside the resolved path, so a mis-resolved directory is
#         still visible to the reader.
#       * dirty-file count: zero is the healthy state on a clean tree.
#       * the todos fold's `unfoldable (no id)` bucket, printed `no-id`: zero is
#         fine (and the
#         count is always printed, so it can never be confused with "no data").
#       * landed slices: an exactly state-backed newly activated release has no
#         landed slices yet. Its `landed` is empty, `next_slice` is the first
#         complete `remaining_ladder` entry, only that entry may be
#         `IN_PROGRESS`, and no ladder entry has a landing SHA. Any other empty
#         landed result remains a hard failure.
# (4) The resolver uses the same header CLOSED marker as board-currency. Its
#     result, rather than a local reimplementation, is the release authority for
#     this briefing.
#
# ========================== LEDGERS GO THROUGH ledgerwatch ==================
# Never a raw `tail` of the .jsonl. Invocations:
#   steward ledger: `--strategy tail --dry-run --no-status --state-dir <sandbox>`
#   todos ledger:   `--project --json`
# CURSOR SEMANTICS = PEEK, DELIBERATELY. A cold-start briefing must not disturb
# the Steward's real cursor: consuming a delta here would silently drop it from
# the next real `ledgerwatch` poll — a monitor that loses an event is the one
# failure mode that tool is built to prevent. Two independent guarantees:
# `--dry-run` computes the delta without advancing the cursor, AND `--state-dir`
# points at a throwaway sandbox, so the real cursor is not even opened. (The
# sandbox also means the tail run is always a `cold` baseline, which is what we
# want: we need the last 5 entries, not "what changed since some other reader
# last looked".) `--project` is read-only by construction — it never creates,
# reads or advances a cursor at all.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = complete briefing within budget; 1 = at least one empty
# section, and/or over budget (payload still printed); 2 = environment error.
#
# Usage: scripts/steward-orient.sh
set -euo pipefail

# Hard limit 2, mechanically. Belongs BEFORE the first git call: with optional
# locks disabled git never takes .git/index.lock, so a stale stat cache is
# refreshed in memory and never written back, and a lock held by a concurrent
# git command (or a read-only .git) cannot perturb this run. Exported so git
# invoked by CHILD processes (gh, python3, ledgerwatch) inherits it.
