# scripts/tests/lib/governed-surface-fixture.sh — seeds a throwaway fixture repo
# with a governed-surface allowlist + pin that are CONSISTENT with each other, so
# `scripts/preflight.sh --landing` can be exercised inside a fixture.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. DOC-HYGIENE-2 T1e wired scripts/check-governed-surface-pin.sh
# into `preflight.sh --landing` (§9). Every fixture repo that runs `--landing`
# and does NOT carry a pin therefore hard-fails:
#
#   INFO  governed-surface-pin: cannot read the pin scripts/governed-surface-pin.json:
#         [Errno 2] No such file or directory — the gate cannot run, so it refuses to pass
#   HARD  governed-surface-pin: check-governed-surface-pin.sh exited 2 without reporting
#         a specific defect — refusing to certify this tree for landing
#
# THE GATE IS RIGHT AND IS NOT WEAKENED HERE. Refusing to certify a tree whose
# pin it cannot read is exactly the TC-37 anti-vacuity stance: a gate that cannot
# see its subject must never report green. What was incomplete is the FIXTURES —
# they did not model a real checkout. This is the same repair T1b made when its
# ledger-integrity gate started hard-failing the same fixtures: give each fixture
# builder a minimal, consistent instance of what the new gate reads. No bypass,
# no env escape hatch, no `--skip`, no conditional that makes the gate inert.
#
# SYNTHETIC, NOT A COPY OF THE REAL PAIR — DELIBERATE. The pin's own suite
# (scripts/tests/test_check_governed_surface_pin.sh) copies the REAL
# src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json + scripts/governed-surface-pin.json
# into its fixtures, and must: the real pair IS its subject. The three suites that
# use THIS helper are about board currency, ledger integrity and TC-RUBRIC-5 — the
# governed surface is incidental to all of them. Copying the real pair would couple
# them to the real pin's SIGNING STATE, and that state is expected to diverge: the
# gate's own header records that 0.8.20 Slices 20/25/30 are EXPECTED to trip it
# before a fresh HITL sign-off. On that day a legitimate, correct trip would turn
# three unrelated suites red for a reason that has nothing to do with what they
# test. A self-consistent synthetic pair is immune to that, and still exercises the
# gate for the RIGHT reason: it runs, reads both files, and matches.
#
# WHAT THE GATE REQUIRES OF THE PAIR (see check-governed-surface-pin.sh's header):
#   * the pin carries sha256 + git_blob_sha1 of the allowlist file's RAW BYTES;
#   * the pin's allowlist/core/recovery_denylist/runtime_controls lists equal
#     the file's, element for element and in order;
#   * counts.<list> is present, an integer, and equals len(<list>) in BOTH;
#   * recovery_denylist is EXACTLY the five REQ-054 names, in BOTH.
# All four are satisfied by construction below and then VERIFIED by running the
# real gate against the pair (see seed_governed_surface_fixture).
#
# Usage — from a fixture builder, BEFORE its `git add -A`:
#   . "$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/governed-surface-fixture.sh"
#   seed_governed_surface_fixture "$primary"
# The caller commits the files; a linked worktree added afterwards inherits them.

# seed_governed_surface_fixture <repo-dir>
# Writes <repo>/src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json and
# <repo>/scripts/governed-surface-pin.json, then proves the pair passes the real
# gate. Returns non-zero (and says why) if it cannot — a fixture seeder that
# silently produced an unusable pair would just move the confusion downstream.
