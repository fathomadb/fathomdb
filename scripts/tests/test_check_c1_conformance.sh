# scripts/tests/test_check_c1_conformance.sh — coverage for the RUBRIC-H7
# `can-i-deploy` contract-conformance gate (scripts/check-c1-conformance.sh) AND
# for its two wirings: `preflight.sh --landing` (PREVENT) and the always-on CI
# job (DETECT).
#
# WHAT IS BEING PROTECTED: R-20-H7 — as-built FathomDB code still satisfies the
# ratified cross-repo design contract
# dev/design/record-lifecycle-protocol/OPP-12-C1-converged-contract.md at the
# 0.8.20 co-land. The gate is mechanical on purpose ("not humans re-reading
# prose", plan-0.8.20.md §3), and an absent-or-failing gate HOLDS the breaking
# pair. So the gate itself needs a recurrence guard: these arms.
#
# RED-first: the real tree PASSES today, so asserting only against the real repo
# would prove nothing — a `true` script would pass it. Every failure arm below
# therefore runs against a purpose-built DIVERGENT FIXTURE (a mutated COPY of
# the contract, of the pin, or of the source root), so each arm can only go green
# because the predicate actually fired. The real-repo arm is the regression half
# of the same pair.
#
# THE FIXTURES ARE COPIES. Neither the real contract nor the real src/ tree is
# ever written by this suite — mutating them is the exact thing the gate exists
# to catch. Copies live under mktemp -d (the checker takes --contract/--pin/--root
# for exactly this reason); the preflight arms build throwaway git repos + linked
# worktrees.
#
# THE FIXTURE ROOTS ARE BUILT FROM `--list-sources`, not from a hand-maintained
# path list. If a future clause reads a new file, the fixture roots pick it up
# automatically and cannot silently go stale (a stale fixture root would turn
# every source arm into a TC-37 #4 evaporation and stop testing what it claims).
#
# NOTE ON THE WHITESPACE ARM: failing on a formatting-only change is a
# DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED property of a content-hash pin, not an accident — see
# the gate's header. It is asserted here so the behaviour is a contract.
#
# FIX-1 ARMS (arms 12d–12j) are the recurrence guard for codex §9 round 1: two
# [P2] FALSE NEGATIVES in which the gate exited 0 on a tree that violates the
# pinned contract — an open readiness vocabulary guarded only by a blacklist of
# one name, and case-sensitive `absent` regexes over SQL. Both classes were
# swept for and are fixed across every clause that carried them.
#
# FIX-2 ARMS (arms 12k–12p) are the recurrence guard for codex §9 round 2, which
# found three REFINEMENTS of those same two classes: a SQL table name may be
# SCHEMA-QUALIFIED (`main.canonical_attributes`), and an accepted string may be
# admitted OUTSIDE a simple match arm (an `if` guard, an or-pattern). 12p is the
# sweep's own product, in the same narrow-regex class.
#
# FIX-3 ARMS (arms 12q–12u, plus the tree-evaporation and probe-kind arms) are
# the recurrence guard for codex §9 round 3 — a DIFFERENT defect class from
# rounds 1–2. Not a regex shape: a SCOPE bug. Every negative (`absent`) probe read
# ONE FILE (a crate's lib.rs), so a literal, correctly-spelled, fully-qualified
# violation placed in a SIBLING MODULE of the same crate exited 0. Fixed by
# scoping every negative probe to the crate SOURCE TREE and by DELETING the
# file-scoped negative probe kind outright.
#
# FIX-4 ARMS (arms 12v–12ac, plus the `min`-probe-kind arms) are the recurrence
# guard for codex §9 round 4 — a FOURTH distinct class again. Not a regex shape
# (rounds 1–2) and not a file-vs-tree scope bug (round 3): SUBJECT BINDING. Every
# probe below asserted that some text existed SOMEWHERE IN A FILE, while the
# clause it implements is about a NAMED SUBJECT inside that file — a particular
# table's tokenizer, a particular struct's field, a particular enum's variant, a
# particular function's signature or body, a particular index's COLUMNS, a
# particular test's DEFINITION (as opposed to a comment mentioning it). Each
# fixture leaves a DECOY that satisfies the old probe, so each exited 0 while the
# obligation was violated. Fixed by extracting the named subject structurally and
# asserting inside it, and by DELETING the `min` count-probe kind outright.
#
# FIX-5 ARMS (arms 12af–12ag, plus the `fn_defined`-on-a-test guards) are the
# recurrence guard for codex §9 round 5 — two more bounded classes, both of them
# false GREENS on ordinary source text:
#   * THE WRONG CRATE'S SAME-NAMED SYMBOL. A refinement of fix-4. fix-4 asked "is
#     this probe bound to a subject at all?"; round 5 asks "is it bound to the
#     subject THE CLAUSE NAMES?". `C1-TE-DEFAULT-EMBEDDER` is about the ENGINE's
#     shipped default and was probed against the EMBEDDER crate's identically
#     named constant, so flipping the engine's exited 0.
#   * A DISABLED TEST IS NOT A PROOF. Ten clauses are carried by "the named test
#     still exists". Deleting `#[test]` or adding `#[ignore]` leaves a plain
#     function of the same name — the probe passed, `cargo test` stopped running
#     the proof, nothing went red. That is the TC-37 evaporation shape this gate
#     exists to close, and it is a ONE-TOKEN edit that reads as tidy-up.
#
# FIX-6 ARMS (arms 12ai–12aj) are the recurrence guard for codex §9 round 6 — two
# bounded holes, and for the first time in this file they point in OPPOSITE
# directions:
#   * 12ai, A FALSE GREEN — THE RECEIVER. The cohesion-seam clause reads the apply
#     verb's parameter and return TEXT out of its own signature (fix-4), but
#     nothing bound it to the `&self` RECEIVER. A free or associated
#     `fn configure_projections(specs.., drop..) -> Result<ProjectionDelta,
#     EngineError>` carries every probed fragment verbatim while
#     `engine.configure_projections(..)` — the instance verb the pin's evidence
#     records — stops existing, and the gate stayed green.
#   * 12aj, A FALSE RED, and the first one this suite has had to guard. The
#     file-level `#![cfg(..)]` check (fix-5 SWEEP) scanned the WHOLE file for
#     inner attributes, so a pinned test file that later grows a perfectly legal
#     `mod helpers { #![cfg(feature = "x")] .. }` was reported as wholly
#     conditionally compiled — turning the gate RED and blocking CI and
#     `preflight.sh --landing` — while every top-level pinned test still built and
#     ran. Note the INVERTED expectation on that arm (rc=0), and the mirror arms
#     that keep a GENUINE file-level `#![cfg(..)]` red.
#
# FIX-6b ARMS (arm 12ak) are the recurrence guard for a regression THE FIX-6
# PATCH ITSELF OPENED, found by codex re-reviewing that patch: narrowing the
# inner-attribute scan to the file's LEADING HEADER made the walk stop at the
# first byte that is neither whitespace nor `#![`, and a Rust file may legally
# begin with a SHEBANG. `#!/usr/bin/env rust-script` followed by
# `#![cfg(feature = "..")]` therefore compiled every proof in a pinned test file
# out while the gate exited 0 — the same false GREEN the whole-file scan had
# caught. A leading shebang is now part of the header and is skipped, and 12ak
# holds BOTH directions: shebang + `#![cfg(..)]` is red, a shebang alone is not.
#
# FIX-6c ARMS (arm 12al) COMPLETE that same finding rather than opening a new
# round: its scope is the file's own leading inner attributes, and a BOM-prefixed
# one is exactly that. A UTF-8 BOM survives `read_source` (`errors="replace"`
# does not strip it), is NOT whitespace to Python (U+FEFF is category Cf), and is
# not `#!` — so the header walk stopped at byte 0 and a file-level `#![cfg(..)]`
# behind a BOM compiled every proof out at exit 0, the 12ak false green through a
# different first byte. rustc strips one leading BOM BEFORE the shebang rule
# applies, so the skip is ordered the same way and BOM + shebang + `#![cfg(..)]`
# is covered too. Reachability was ZERO when this was written — no tracked file
# carries a BOM — exactly as the shebang hole was latent when 12ak closed it.
#
# READ THE GATE'S "RESIDUAL SCOPE" HEADER SECTION BEFORE ADDING A ROUND 7, AND
# CLASSIFY THE FINDING FIRST. The header states, in writing, the evasion classes a
# static/lexical check CANNOT close (dynamically composed SQL, const/macro-
# indirected identifiers, ATTACH aliases, normalising comparisons, and what a
# still-active test's BODY actually asserts); arms for those belong to a DIFFERENT
# mechanism — a runtime `sqlite_master` assertion, a real parse, or asking the
# toolchain which tests the built binary contains — not to another regex here. But
# rounds 3 through 6 were NOT one of those: a LITERAL spelling of a PINNED name in
# ordinary source text that this gate does not see, a probe satisfied by something
# other than its subject, a proof that no longer runs, a verb that lost its
# receiver, and a legal nested module misread as a switched-off file are real
# defects with definite fixes, and they get fixed.

# === Arm 12v–12ac (RED, fix-4): A PROBE MUST BE BOUND TO ITS SUBJECT =========
# codex §9 round 4 [P2], plus the sweep for the same shape everywhere else. This
# is a FOURTH distinct class, and again not a regex-shape or scope problem: each
# probe below was pointed at a FILE rather than at THE THING THE CLAUSE IS ABOUT,
# so an unrelated coincidence elsewhere in that same file satisfied it while the
# named subject was broken.
#
# The shape, in one sentence: a `present`/`min` probe over a whole file asserts
# "this text exists SOMEWHERE in this file", but every one of these clauses says
# something about a NAMED subject — property_search_index's tokenizer,
# ProjectionSpec's `roles` field, EngineError's variant, the apply verb's
# signature, the index's COLUMNS, the named test's DEFINITION.
#
# EVERY FIXTURE BELOW LEAVES A DECOY (or an existing unrelated occurrence) that
# satisfies the OLD probe, so every one of them exited 0 before this round while
# the contract obligation was violated in the tree.

# 12v — codex §9 round 4's own demonstration, verbatim: ONLY
# `property_search_index`'s tokenizer is changed. The old probe counted file-wide
# occurrences of the default tokenizer string (`min`, n=2) and the schema file
# carries several for UNRELATED FTS tables (search_index, search_index_v2, the
# edge index), so the count stayed satisfied by tables the clause is not about.

# asking the NEXT question: fix-4 asked "is this probe bound to a SUBJECT at all,

# NAMES, or to a different file that happens to contain a similar symbol?" — and
# a probe can be perfectly, structurally bound and still bound to the wrong thing.
#
# C1-TE-DEFAULT-EMBEDDER's obligation is "the default embedder is THE ENGINE'S
# SHIPPED DEFAULT". The probe read `DEFAULT_EMBEDDER_NAME` out of the EMBEDDER
# crate's candle_bge.rs. BOTH crates declare a constant of that exact name; only
# the engine's is the shipped default. Every arm below exited 0 before this round.
#
# The fix asserts the RELATION (both constants exist, agree, and equal the pinned
# value) rather than swapping one crate for the other — the engine fails closed

# 12ah-1 — THE `[[test]]` TARGET GATE, and this one is not hypothetical.
# fathomdb-engine/Cargo.toml ALREADY declares nineteen `[[test]]` blocks with
# `required-features`, because that is how the crate legitimately keeps its
# operator-only and reranker-only suites out of the default build. So "somebody
# adds a required-features to a test target" is an ESTABLISHED PATTERN in this
# exact file — the fix-3 argument about sibling modules, one level up. Adding one

# codex §9 round 6 finding #2, and THE DIRECTION IS INVERTED versus every other

#
# The fix-5 SWEEP taught `test_defined` that a file-level `#![cfg(..)]` switches
# every proof in a file off (arm 12ah-2). The reader it used scanned the WHOLE
# file for `#![`, and Rust permits an inner attribute at the head of ANY braced
# item — `mod helpers { #![cfg(feature = "x")] .. }` is ordinary, legal, and
# switches off THAT MODULE alone. One of those in a pinned test file made the
# gate report the whole integration test as conditionally compiled: exit 1, CI
# and `preflight.sh --landing` blocked, with every top-level pinned proof still
# building and running. No such module exists in the tree today; this arm is here
# so the first one to arrive does not stop the release.

# === Arm 12ak (RED, fix-6b): A LEADING SHEBANG IS PART OF THE HEADER =========
# codex §9 round 6 RE-REVIEW, and this one is a regression THE FIX-6 PATCH ABOVE
# OPENED. Narrowing the file-level `#![..]` scan to the file's LEADING HEADER
# (arm 12aj) closed the nested-module false RED, but the new walk stops at the
# first byte that is neither whitespace nor `#![` — and a Rust source file may
# legally BEGIN WITH A SHEBANG. `#!/usr/bin/env rust-script` is not `#![`, so the
# walk ended at byte 0 and a file-level `#![cfg(..)]` on the NEXT line was never
# seen: exit 0 on a pinned test file whose every proof is compiled out. codex
# proved it with the toolchain, not by reading — `rustc --test` on
# shebang + `#![cfg(feature = "nope")]` + `#[test] fn t() {}` builds, and
# `--list` reports `0 tests`.
#
# The pre-fix-6 whole-file scan caught this. These arms keep BOTH directions
# closed at once: the shebang must not hide a file-level `#![cfg(..)]` (12ak-1,
# 12ak-3, rc=1) and must not by itself gate anything (12ak-2, rc=0). The nested
# module mirror — the false RED fix-6 closed — is arm 12aj above and is NOT
# duplicated here; it must stay rc=0 for this repair to be in scope.
#
# 12ak-1 — codex's own demonstration: a shebang line, then a genuine file-level
# `#![cfg(..)]`. Same subject file as the 12aj mirror arms, so the only variable
# against them is the shebang.

# === Arm 12al (RED, fix-6c): A LEADING UTF-8 BOM IS PART OF THE HEADER =======
# The completion of codex §9 round-6 finding #2, whose scope is "the file's own
# leading inner attributes" — and a BOM-prefixed inner attribute is one. Exactly
# the SHEBANG hole of 12ak, through a different first byte.
#
# `read_source` decodes bytes with `.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")`, which
# does NOT strip a byte-order mark, so a BOM survives into the scanned text as
# U+FEFF at index 0. The leading-header walk then fails three ways at once:
# `code[:2] == "#!"` is False so the shebang branch is skipped; `"﻿"
# .isspace()` is False in Python 3 (it is category Cf, a FORMAT character, not
# whitespace) so the whitespace skip does not advance past it; and
# `code[0:3] != "#!["` so the walk breaks at byte 0. A file-level `#![cfg(..)]`
# on the very same line is never seen — every proof in a pinned test file is
# compiled out and the gate exits 0. A false GREEN of exactly the 12ak class.
#
# Proved with the toolchain, not by reading. `rustc --test` on a file whose
# bytes begin ef bb bf, then `#![cfg(feature = "nope")]` + `#[test] fn t() {}`,
# builds and `--list` reports `0 tests`; the same file WITHOUT the cfg reports
# `1 test`, so it is the cfg that empties it and not the BOM. rustc strips ONE
# leading BOM and only then may the first line be a shebang, so BOM + shebang +
# `#![cfg(..)]` also builds to `0 tests` — hence 12al-3, and hence the BOM skip
# belongs BEFORE the shebang branch rather than after it.
#
# Reachability is ZERO today: no tracked source file carries a BOM. So was the
# shebang hole when 12ak was written. These arms hold both directions, as 12ak
# does: a BOM must not hide a file-level `#![cfg(..)]` (12al-1, 12al-3, rc=1)
# and must not by itself gate anything (12al-2, rc=0).
#
# 12al-1 — a BOM, then a genuine file-level `#![cfg(..)]` on the same line. Same
# subject file as the 12aj/12ak mirrors, so the BOM is the only variable.
