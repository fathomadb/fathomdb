# scripts/tests/test_check_design_refs.sh — TC-92 recurrence guard
# (DOC-HYGIENE-3): A REQUIREMENT ID MUST HAVE DESIGN COVERAGE AT THE MOMENT IT
# IS MINTED.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE INCIDENT (measured, at the Slice 22 commission)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `scripts/commission-manifest.sh 0.8.20 22` exited 1 with
#     ZERO design docs matched 0.8.20 Slice 22 (tokens: TC-67, TC-68, R-20-VC)
# — its TC-37 vacuous-pass guard, working exactly as designed. THE ALARM WAS
# REAL AND THE DIAGNOSIS WAS NOT "the design does not exist": the design of
# record existed for every leg and was found in minutes. The ids were minted
# 2026-07-27, long after those documents were written, so a LITERAL TOKEN SCAN
# CANNOT SEE A DEPENDENCY THAT RUNS BACKWARD IN TIME.
#
# The consequence is bimodal. Zero matches hard-fails and cannot be commissioned
# — loud, recoverable, and what happened to Slice 22. ONE weak incidental match
# emits a brief whose required reading is thin but LOOKS complete — quiet, and
# worse. Slice 21 was the second shape: it matched exactly one doc, on TC-71,
# and the manifest honestly printed `NO design doc mentions: ac_002, TC-57,
# R-20-CR`. That line was correct and was easy to read past.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS ALREADY FIXED, AND WHAT IS NOT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Slice 22 was unblocked by hand-annotating five docs with a "Requirement
# traceability" blockquote. That approach is SUPERSEDED by `design_refs` (a
# curated per-ladder-entry citation list, d30ef52f) and is not the remedy here.
#
# THE UNFIXED HALF IS THE DISCIPLINE GAP: nothing requires a back-link at the
# moment a requirement id is minted. That is remedy (a) in TC-92, and this suite
# gates the mechanical version of it — `scripts/check-design-refs.sh`, wired into
# the pre-commit hook so it fires exactly when the state file or the design tier
# is staged.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PREDICATE UNDER TEST
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For every ladder entry in every `dev/plans/release-state-*.json`, every token
# the entry declares must have design coverage: a design doc that whole-token
# matches it, or a curated `design_refs` document that does. Anything else must
# appear in the check's own FROZEN BASELINE EXEMPTION table, and anything not in
# that table is a hard failure — on a LANDED slice or a future one alike.
#
# IT IS A RATCHET, NOT A SNAPSHOT. Arm 11 pins that it is NOT implemented as
# "skip LANDED slices": that would let a new landed gap through, which is the
# exact quiet failure mode TC-92 is about.
#
# NO TOKEN DERIVATION OF ITS OWN (arm 6). The check DRIVES
# `scripts/commission-manifest.sh` and reads its coverage report, so the two can
# never disagree about what a slice's tokens are. Arm 7 pins the manifest's
# stdout byte-identical to the base commit for all 14 real ladder slices, because
# the `design_refs` mechanism's whole safety argument rests on that byte-identity.
#
# LOCAL-ONLY BY DESIGN (arm 9). CI does not invoke `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` and
# does not auto-discover `scripts/tests/*`. Every check in
# `scripts/preflight.sh --landing` is deliberately paired with a mirrored CI job;
# this one is not, so it must stay out of preflight and out of agent-test.sh.
#
# Isolation: the failing arms run in a throwaway git repo under mktemp -d, built
# around `scripts/tests/fixtures/release-state-9.9.9-design-refs.json`. Nothing
# here writes into the real checkout, and the real `release-state-0.8.20.json` is
# never mutated (arm 12).

# THE [P1], stated as the property it actually violated. With `GIT_DIR` still
# exported, `git init -q --template= "$SNAPSHOT"` does not create
# `$SNAPSHOT/.git` at all — GIT_DIR wins, so git REINITIALISES THE GATED
# REPOSITORY instead. MEASURED: `git init` under an exported GIT_DIR rewrites
# that repository's `.git/config`; the gate's three real-side reads
# (`diff --cached`, `ls-files --unmerged`, `checkout-index`) leave the admin
# directory byte-for-byte untouched, so this signature is a stable assertion and
# not a flaky one.
#
# A gate whose header says READ-ONLY must be read-only. This is also the honest
# statement of the defect: the verdict happened to stay correct (the manifest's
# `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` degrades to `cd ""`, a bash no-op), so
# a verdict-only assertion CANNOT see this — which is exactly how the old arm 17
# passed over it.
# `cksum` (POSIX) rather than `md5sum` (GNU). And the raw listing is emitted
# BEFORE hashing so the caller can assert it is NON-EMPTY: `find -printf` is
# GNU-only, and on BSD it would fail, hash nothing, and yield the SAME constant
# both times — an arm about fail-open that itself fails open.

# that was the PRIMARY CHECKOUT, which gained `bare = true` and refused every
# work-tree operation while `git rev-parse HEAD` still resolved.
#
# The remedy is not a better-ordered environment scrub. A guard on the commit
# path must not be ABLE to damage what it guards, so the single writing git call
# was REMOVED: the snapshot is made a repository with `mkdir` and `printf`, no
# git binary involved. With no write in the path, a leaked GIT_* can at worst
