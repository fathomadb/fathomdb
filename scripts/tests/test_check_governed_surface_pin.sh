#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/tests/test_check_governed_surface_pin.sh — coverage for the governed-
# surface pin gate (scripts/check-governed-surface-pin.sh) AND for its two
# wirings: `preflight.sh --landing` (PREVENT) and the always-on CI job (DETECT).
#
# WHAT IS BEING PROTECTED: the HITL signed the accumulated governed-surface
# delta of 0.8.20 Slices 5d+10b+15b+15d (AC-079), later signed deltas, and the
# Slice 22 C5 pair and the explicitly commissioned Slice 30 addition — pinned to the exact content of
# src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json at the provenance commit
# recorded in the pin (35 allowlist members, 5 core, recovery_denylist unchanged
# at the five REQ-054 names). A signature keyed to specific content is worth
# exactly as much as the mechanism that notices when that content moves.
#
# RED-first: the file MATCHES the pin today, so asserting only against the real
# repo would prove nothing — a `true` script would pass it. Every failure arm
# below therefore runs against a purpose-built DIVERGENT FIXTURE, so each arm can
# only go green because the predicate actually fires. The real-repo arm is the
# regression half of the same pair.
#
# THE FIXTURES ARE COPIES. src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json is
# NEVER written by this suite — mutating it is the exact thing the gate exists to
# catch. Copies live under mktemp -d (the checker takes --file/--pin for exactly
# this reason); the preflight arms build throwaway git repos + linked worktrees.
#
# NOTE ON ARM 5 (whitespace-only): failing on a formatting-only change is a
# DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED property of a content-hash pin, not an accident — see
# the gate's header. It is asserted here so the behaviour is a contract.
#
# NOTE ON ARMS 8b-8f (the pin's own well-formedness): Arm 8 proves the counts
# block is what catches a lazy re-pin, which makes the counts block itself a
# target. These arms attack it: a pin that DELETES, nulls or mistypes one of its
# three counts must fail as a MALFORMED PIN (exit 2 — the gate could not run),
# never skip that list and never be reported as a surface divergence (exit 1 —
# "go get it signed"). Each was captured exiting 0 on the pre-fix gate.
