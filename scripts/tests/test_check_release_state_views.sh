# scripts/tests/test_check_release_state_views.sh — T2a recurrence guard
# (DOC-HYGIENE-2): the single-writer release-state file + its generated views.
#
# The incident this closes: 0.8.20's release state — landed slices + SHAs, the
# SCHEMA version, the next slice, AC status, ruled/unruled decisions — was
# narrated across a 5-12 file write-side fan-out with NOTHING checking that the
# copies agreed. One reconciliation commit (b70629e5) had to touch SEVEN files,
# and the live board is ~79 KB, so nobody reads it whole and a wrong copy can
# sit unnoticed for weeks.
#
# Predicate under test (see scripts/check-release-state-views.sh for the full
# statement): for every view a `dev/plans/release-state-*.json` file declares,
# the bytes between its BEGIN/END markers must EQUAL the bytes the renderer
# produces from that state file — plus marker well-formedness, the orphan-marker
# confinement rule, an unknown-view-id failure, and the TC-37 vacuous-pass guard.
#
# RED-first: the predicate passes on the real repo today, so asserting against
# the real checkout alone would prove nothing (a `true` script would pass it).
# Every failure arm below runs against a purpose-built fixture repo in which the
# fault is deliberately planted, so an arm can only go green because the
# predicate actually fired. The real-repo arm is the regression half of the pair.
#
# NON-VACUITY: the suite honours $GATE_UNDER_TEST, so a MUTANT gate (one whose
# region diff always compares equal) can be pointed at it. That mutant turns
# this suite RED — which is the evidence that a green here is load-bearing
# rather than a script that merely exits 0.
#
# Isolation: fixtures are throwaway git repos under mktemp -d (the gate does
# `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`, so each fixture needs to BE a repo).
# Nothing here writes into the real checkout.

# ===========================================================================
# TC-89, arms 10a-10f: the PLAN's "IMMEDIATE NEXT" pointer is a GENERATED VIEW.
# ===========================================================================
# THE MEASURED FAILURE. `dev/plans/plan-0.8.20.md` §9 carried a HAND-WRITTEN
# "IMMEDIATE NEXT: Slice N" pointer while `release-state-0.8.20.json` already
# owned `next_slice` and was already kept true at every landing. It went stale at
# THREE CONSECUTIVE COMMISSIONS. Twice measured in a single session: at the Slice
# 21 commission it still said "Slice 30" although Slice 30 had landed at
# 9b3ed0e3 (fixed at 62486a01, but only because the Steward happened to read the
# anchor); hours later, immediately after Slice 21 landed, it said "Slice 21".
#
# WHY IT IS WORSE THAN ORDINARY DOC ROT. `scripts/commission-manifest.sh`
# resolves `## 9. Immediate next slice` as the `{{MANDATE}}` anchor for an
# orchestrator brief, and its CHECK 2 verifies that the HEADING EXISTS, not that
# the prose under it is current. A heading cannot rot; the prose under it does.
# So a generated, path-verified brief handed an orchestrator a hand-written
# pointer at the wrong slice, with the manifest's authority behind it, and the
# staleness was copied into the next commission.
#
# THE REMEDY IS THE ONE DOC-HYGIENE-2 ALREADY BUILT, not a second mechanism: a
# `generated_views` entry + a renderer here + marker-delimited region, so drift
# is mechanically impossible rather than something each Steward must remember at
# land time. The interim mitigation that was in place — a warning blockquote
# telling the reader to re-verify against `next_slice` — is a NOTE, not a
# control, and notes are what this repo has ruled against.
#
# The expectations below are written LONGHAND, exactly as GATE_SENTENCE is, so a
# renderer change that alters the claim cannot also silently alter the
# expectation.

# Arms 11a-11h — SLICE-ID-HARDENING (0.8.20 cross-cutting unit, brief §1b).
#
# WHY A DEDICATED FIXTURE AND NOT THE REAL STATE FILE. `release-state-0.8.20.json`
# carries NO fractional slice id anywhere: `landed` is all ints, `next_slice` is
# the int 40, every `ladder[].slice` is an int. Against that state every defect
# below is INERT — `"%d" % 40` == `str(40)` == `_slice_str(40)` == `"40"` — so an
# arm pointed at the real checkout would be green before the fix and green after
# it. Vacuous by construction. The whole point of these arms is a state file that
# carries fractional AND integral-float ids, which is what `frac_fixture` builds.
#
# WHAT THE FIXTURE PLANTS, and which call site each value reaches:
#   landed              [0, 5.0, 10.5]   -> :278 handoff chain (bare str)
#   remaining_ladder    [20, 30.5, 40.0] -> :168 master ladder (bare str)
#   unblocked           [20, 30.0]       -> :154 _and_join (bare str), via :264
#   publish_precondition_slice  30.5     -> :260 by[int(...)] (INDEX truncation)
#   ladder 30.5 .slice  30.5             -> :263 `Slice %d` (RENDER truncation)
#   ladder 30.5 .depends_on [5,10.0,20]  -> :265 str(d) (bare str)
#   sign_off_slice      40.5             -> :233/:242/:248 `Slice %d` (truncation)
#
# THE FENCED REGIONS BELOW HOLD THE POST-FIX BYTES, HAND-WRITTEN. They are NOT
# produced by running the gate with --write: a fixture written by the tool under
# test and then checked by that same tool agrees with itself whatever the tool
# does, which is the canary-hashing-nothing failure this release already had
# once. Writing the expectation out longhand is what makes the diff evidence.
# ===========================================================================

# The publish-gate sentence with a FRACTIONAL sign_off_slice, longhand — an
# independent restatement of what the renderer must emit, exactly as gate_facts
# does for the integral case.

# The RENDER, read straight out of the gate's own diff diagnostic.
#
# WHY NOT JUST ASSERT rc=0. A green gate prints one `ok` line and nothing else,
# so a green run carries NO evidence about what was rendered — an assertion of
# the form "the output does not contain 40.0" is satisfied trivially by a gate
# that prints nothing at all. That is the same shape as this release's canary
# that hashed nothing on both sides and compared equal.
#
# So each arm below deliberately PERTURBS one byte inside the region it cares
# about. The gate then reports that region STALE and prints, verbatim, the bytes
# it rendered from the state file. Those bytes are the evidence, and they are
# available identically before and after the fix — which is what lets one arm
# assert the WRONG string pre-fix and the RIGHT string post-fix, positively, in
# both directions.
#
# NON-VACUITY: an empty render, or a run that did not fail, fails the arm.
#
# The render is extracted FOR A NAMED VIEW ID, never as "the first render in the
# output". Against the UNFIXED gate several regions are stale at once, so a
# positional grep would hand every arm the master-ladder render and each arm
# would then be asserting about a view it does not own — a verification-apparatus
# defect of exactly the class that consumed five of six codex fix rounds across
# Slices 32/33.

# were unpushed. All twenty were genuinely on the remote.

# red, which is how a real failure survives. Absent history means UNVERIFIABLE.
