# scripts/tests/test_commission_manifest.sh — T3b recurrence guard
# (DOC-HYGIENE-2): the GENERATED COMMISSION MANIFEST.
#
# The incident this closes: briefing an orchestrator for a slice meant
# hand-assembling the same citation list every time — design-of-record paths,
# contract paths, plan section anchors, the base SHA, the worktree rules, the
# stop conditions — out of a 5-12 file fan-out, with NOTHING checking that the
# cited paths still resolved. T1d already measured what that costs: the TC-45
# line anchors in plan-0.8.20.md were ~2,100 lines off and had never been
# correct. A citation nobody checks is a citation that rots silently.
#
# Predicate under test (see scripts/commission-manifest.sh for the statement):
# for a given release + slice, the emitted manifest cites only paths that EXIST
# and only anchors that actually OCCUR in the file they name — and it hard-fails
# rather than emitting anything if either is false, or if it would emit nothing.
#
# RED-first: the predicate passes on the real repo today (arm 8), so asserting
# against the real checkout alone would prove nothing — a `true` script would
# pass it. Every failure arm below runs against a purpose-built fixture repo in
# which exactly one fault is planted, so an arm can only go green because the
# generator's own check fired.
#
# NON-VACUITY: the suite honours $GATE_UNDER_TEST, so a MUTANT generator — one
# whose path-existence test always answers "exists" — can be pointed at it. That
# mutant turns arms 1/1b RED, which is the evidence that a green here is
# load-bearing rather than a script that merely exits 0.
#
# SECOND PREDICATE (codex §9 [P2], arms 8e-8j): the emitted base SHA is the
# TARGET SLICE'S PREDECESSOR — the greatest LANDED slice strictly below it —
# never max(landed). Measured RED against the pre-fix generator: with Slice 10
# in `landed`, the manifest for Slice 10 printed
#   `base sha  dddd5555  (Slice 10, the newest LANDED slice's landing merge)`
# i.e. branch from the very work you are being commissioned to do; and with a
# later slice landed it printed Slice 30's merge as the base for Slice 10. That
# is the agent-worktree-stale-base trap in printed form, and it becomes live the
# moment 0.8.20 Slice 20 lands. These arms assert the base LINE specifically,
# because every landing SHA also appears in the `landed so far` roll-up and a
# whole-output grep therefore cannot distinguish a right base from a wrong one.
#
# THIRD PREDICATE (codex §9 [P2], arms 5h/5i/9e): the publish gate's
# `pre_sign.pinned_to` is a REGISTERED CITATION, not printed text. It names the
# file whose content the HITL pre-sign is bound to, and it was emitted raw — so
# a mistyped or renamed pin path was still printed while `--verify` reported 0
# dead citations and CI stayed green. That is CHECK 1's guarantee not holding
# over the one path it matters most for. Arm 5h asserts the failure direction, 5i
# asserts the verified-path COUNT moves (a bolted-on existence check beside the
# citation list would satisfy 5h alone), and 9e asserts it on the live state file.
#
# Isolation: fixtures are throwaway git repos under mktemp -d (the generator
# does `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`, so each fixture must BE a repo).
# Nothing here writes into the real checkout — arm 9 asserts that mechanically.

# ===========================================================================
# FOURTH PREDICATE (TC-92 / TC-94), arms 11a-11h: a slice may CITE its design
# docs by hand, and a cited doc is checked exactly like every other citation.
# ===========================================================================
# THE INCIDENT, MEASURED. The design tier has two DISCOVERY selectors — a
# filename selector (`<release>-slice-NN-*.md`) and a token selector over
# `dev/design/**` content — and an entire class of slice defeats both BY
# CONSTRUCTION. `plan-<release>.md` §3 is frozen at Slice 0, so a RESERVED-GAP
# slice minted mid-release by HITL ruling carries requirement ids (R-20-CR,
# R-20-VC, R-20-SV and their TC-* carries) that appear NOWHERE in dev/design/**,
# and it never got a §3.0 memo of its own either. The filename selector hit
# exactly 1 of the 12 slices in the 0.8.20 ladder. The TC-37 vacuous-pass guard
# therefore hard-failed (exit 1) on a perfectly well-designed slice — three in a
# row: Slices 21, 22 and 23.
#
# The fix is an OPTIONAL `design_refs` list on the ladder entry. It is CITATION,
# not discovery, and three properties are the whole point:
#   * ABSENT MEANS ABSENT (arm 11d) — every byte of the manifest for a slice
#     without `design_refs` is what it was before the feature existed, asserted
#     against the PRE-CHANGE generator recovered from git, not against a
#     hand-copied golden.
#   * A CURATED PATH IS A CHECKED PATH (arm 11b) — CHECK 1 applies with no
#     exemption, because curation nobody checks rots exactly like a scan hit.
#   * IT REACHES OUTSIDE `dev/design/` (arms 11c/11c2) — dev/adr/**,
#     dev/interfaces/** — which the scan's walker can never do.
# And the guard it unblocks must not be weakened by it (arms 11e/11e2).

# --- Arm 11a: a `design_refs` doc reaches §6, marked CURATED ----------------

# git by walking this file's history back to the newest revision that does not
# mention `design_refs` — against the current one, over the SAME fixture, with
# no `design_refs` anywhere in the state file. Any drift at all is a fail.
#
# NON-VACUITY: every way the recovery can come up empty (squashed history, a
# shallow clone, the file renamed) routes to fail(), never to a silent pass. A
# comparison that quietly compares nothing is worse than no comparison.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TWO CHANGES MADE HERE BY DOC-HYGIENE-3, both loud on purpose.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (1) IT USED TO ABORT THE WHOLE SUITE ON ITS FIRST REAL DRIFT. The drift capture
#     ran `$(diff … | head -20 | tr …)` under `set -euo pipefail`; `diff` exits 1
#     when the files differ, `pipefail` propagates that through the pipeline, the
#     assignment inherits it, and the `||` compound therefore returned 1 — so the
#     first genuine difference killed the script instead of reporting it. MEASURED
#     here: the suite exited 1 after arm 11c2 with NO `FAIL` line printed and 25
#     later arms never run. A test that dies rather than reports is worse than a
#     test that is wrong, because its silence reads like the end of a clean run.
#     Fixed by capturing the diff with `|| true`.
#
# (2) ONE ENUMERATED, JUSTIFIED ALLOWANCE. TC-94 defect 1 widened the design scan
#     from `dev/design` alone to `dev/design` + `dev/adr` + `dev/interfaces`, and
#     the manifest DISCLOSES the roots it scanned in its own header. That header
#     line therefore differs from the pre-change generator's, for a reason that
#     has nothing to do with `design_refs`. Freezing the whole output against a
#     historical revision forever is the TC-81 time-bomb class this suite already
#     rejected once (see arm 9d's history): any correct improvement to the tool
#     turns it red against a tool that is right.
#
#     The allowance is NOT "ignore differences". Exactly one line is exempt, it is
#     named by its literal text, and BOTH sides must still carry it — so a second
#     drifting line, or the disappearance of the header line altogether, is still

#     property `design_refs` actually needs.
# (3) THE BASELINE RECOVERY WAS NON-DETERMINISTIC, and it silently chose the

#     exits the moment it matches, which SIGPIPEs `git show` (exit 141). A
#     non-zero pipeline then reads as "this revision does not mention
#     design_refs" and the loop breaks on it. MEASURED here across three

#     times. An additivity arm comparing the tool against a baseline that already
#     has the feature proves nothing while printing a green line naming a SHA.
#     Fixed by materialising the blob first and grepping the variable, and by

# ===========================================================================
# FIFTH PREDICATE (TC-100 + TC-94 defects 1 and 2), arms 12a-12k: the DISCOVERY
# half selects the RIGHT documents — matched on WHOLE tokens, over the three
# roots that actually hold design authority, for EVERY leg the ladder entry
# names including the bare-number ones.
# ===========================================================================
# Three measured defects in one selector, all of which make the required-reading
# list wrong rather than merely short:
#
#  TC-100 — SUBSTRING MATCHING. `matched = [t for t in tokens if t in text]` has
#    no word boundary, so the token `C-1` matches inside `TC-15`, `TC-100`,
#    `TC-19`… MEASURED on the live repo before this change: 0.8.20 Slice 15 cited
#    EIGHTEEN documents on that one token, among them
#    `dev/design/0.8.4-graphrag-sensemaking.md` and four
#    `fathomdb-memex-overall-roadmap/*` drafts that cannot inform a projection
#    registry. A brief is a REQUIRED-READING list: padding it spends the
#    orchestrator's context on documents that cannot help, and — worse — makes a
#    slice with genuinely thin design coverage look thoroughly supported, which
#    is the exact condition the TC-37 vacuous-pass guard exists to surface. Short
#    ids are the hazard: `C-1`, `C-2`, and any `AC-NN`/`TC-NN` that is a prefix
#    of a longer id.
#
#  TC-94 (1) — UNREACHABLE TIERS. `scan_design` walked `dev/design` alone, so
#    `dev/adr/**` and `dev/interfaces/**` could never appear in a brief AT ANY
#    STATUS, no matter what was back-linked into them. An ADR is a HIGHER tier of
#    authority than a design memo (`ADR-0.6.0-error-taxonomy.md` is the ruling
#    document for decision #18; `ADR-0.8.18-vector-equivalence-self-check.md` is
#    HITL-SIGNED), and `dev/interfaces/*.md` is the surface AGENTS.md §25 obliges
#    an error-surface change to update — so the scan was blind to precisely the
#    strongest evidence. `design_refs` is NOT a fix for this: it is the CITATION
#    half, it requires a human to have known to curate, and the eight ladder
#    entries with no curation got nothing.
#
#  TC-94 (2) — BARE-NUMBER LEGS ARE INVISIBLE. `slice_tokens` derives tokens by
#    regex from the ladder entry's own `short`/`title`, and the shapes `#18` and
#    `#99` match none of its patterns. Two of 0.8.20 Slice 22's four legs
#    therefore contributed NOTHING to selection and no document could ever be
#    matched for them.
#
# (TC-94 defect (3) as originally filed — "a full token match SUPPRESSES the
# manifest's own NO-design-doc-mentions warning" — was WITHDRAWN as FALSE at
# steward `seq-146`, measured: the report is per-token and always has been. Arm
# 11f already locks that behaviour and is labelled as a lock, not a RED-first
# test. Nothing here re-opens it.)
#
# THE FIXES ARE COUPLED AND THEIR EVIDENCE IS A DIFF. Word-boundary matching
# SHRINKS the cited set, widening the roots GROWS it, and bare-number tokens grow
# it again — so "it still exits 0" proves nothing. The before/after citation-set
# diff across every landed 0.8.20 slice is recorded at
# `dev/plans/runs/DOC-HYGIENE-3-citation-set-diff.md`; these arms pin the
# MECHANISM the diff is evidence for.

# --- Arm 12a: a SHORT token must not match inside a LONGER id (TC-100) ------
# The fixture form of the live Slice-15 defect. `longer-id-only.md` says `TC-15`
# and `TC-100` and never `C-1` on its own; `genuine-c1.md` states the token. Both
# were cited before this change — measured RED, and the pair is what makes the
# arm about BOUNDARIES rather than about matching less.

# --- Arm 9d: the real repo's base line, STATE-DERIVED (TC-79 / TC-81) -------
# The live regression half of the predecessor fix. It asserts the base LINE and
# not the whole manifest, because every landing SHA also appears in the `landed
# so far` roll-up, so a whole-manifest grep cannot tell a correct base from a
# wrong one. That intent is unchanged.
#
# WHY IT IS DERIVED RATHER THAN LITERAL. The previous form hardcoded Slice 20 as
# its "currently in flight" example, hardcoded Slice 15 / a2022957 as the
# expected base, and asserted UNCONDITIONALLY that the real manifest carried no
# HISTORICAL banner. Its own comment said the predecessor and max(landed) agree
# "TODAY" — it documented its own expiry date and shipped anyway. Slice 20 then
# landed (841c307b), the generator CORRECTLY began emitting
# `⚠ HISTORICAL  Slice 20 is ITSELF LANDED`, and this arm went permanently RED
# against a tool that was right: a time-bombed assertion, the TC-81 hazard class
# (first instance efa8d584). Re-pointing the literal at a later slice is the
# same bomb with a later fuse, so it was rejected.
#
# The form below reads the target (`next_slice`, unlanded by definition), its
# predecessor (the greatest `landed` entry STRICTLY below the target) and that
# predecessor's landing SHA out of the single-writer state file, and asserts the
# HISTORICAL banner as an EQUIVALENCE: present if and only if the target is
# itself in `landed`. That is strictly stronger than the old one-directional
# prohibition — it now also catches a banner that fails to appear — and it stays
# true whatever the ladder does next.
#
# NON-VACUITY IS THE POINT: there is no skip path. Every way the derivation can
# come up empty (end-of-ladder `next_slice: null`, no landed predecessor, a
# predecessor with no recorded SHA, an unreadable state file) routes to fail(),
# never to a silent pass. A vacuously-green gate is worse than the bug it was
# meant to catch, and this repo has been bitten by exactly that before.
#
# THE ORACLE IS A FUNCTION, not an inline heredoc, because arm 13g grades the
# SAME oracle against a fractional-id state file. An oracle that only ever ran
# against the all-integer live state could never be shown to be wrong about a
# fractional one — which is exactly how this arm came to REPLICATE the
# generator's own int-only assumptions (brief §1c) instead of falsifying them.
#
# ⛔ AND IT MUST NOT REPLICATE THE GENERATOR'S ASSUMPTIONS. An oracle that copies
# the implementation cannot falsify it. This one did, in TWO places (brief §1c):
#
#   * `isinstance(t, int)` on `next_slice` routed a FRACTIONAL target to
#     `ERR … not an int` -> fail(), so the arm REJECTED the very input this
#     unit exists to support. That is what made this suite rc=1 outright while
#     `Slice 39.5` sat in the ladder.
#   * `isinstance(n, int)` on `landed` was semantically identical to the
#     generator's own defect at commission-manifest.sh:701 — filtering a whole
#     landed unit out of the predecessor set, in the check written to catch
#     exactly that.
#
# Repairing only one of them leaves the other live, so both are stated here, and
# arm 13h grades this function against a fractional state file where each is
# independently observable (a fractional target AND a fractional predecessor).

# sites 2 and 3, and §4 [DETERMINE] duty 2).
#
# WHY A FIXTURE AND NOT THE REAL STATE FILE. `release-state-0.8.20.json` carries
# NO fractional slice id anywhere — `landed` is all ints, `next_slice` is the int
# 40, every `ladder[].slice` is an int. Against that state :701's `isinstance`
# filter is a NO-OP and :497's `%d` truncation NEVER FIRES, because `slice_no` is
# always an int. An arm pointed at the real checkout is therefore green before
# the fix and green after it: vacuous by construction. Fractional ids belong in
# throwaway fixtures, and nowhere near the real ladder or board.
#
# ⚠ ONE EXCEPTION, and it is not hypothetical: site 3's neighbour bleed IS LIVE
# in this checkout. `dev/design/0.8.20-slice-39.5-collect-all-test-harness.md`
# and `dev/design/0.8.20-slice-39-publish-facing-documentation.md` both exist, and
# the shipped pattern `slice[-_ ]?0*39(?![0-9])` matches BOTH — so Slice 39's
# commission cites Slice 39.5's design memo as its own. Arm 13i asserts that on
# the real checkout.
