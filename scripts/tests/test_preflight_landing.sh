# scripts/tests/test_preflight_landing.sh — coverage for `preflight.sh --landing`.
#
# TC-RUBRIC-5 (HITL-ADOPTED 2026-07-11) requires that release orchestration and
# ALL landing git-writes run in a dedicated linked worktree, never in the primary
# checkout. `--landing` is the mechanical enforcement of that rule, per the
# standing guardrail-failures-fix-tooling-not-people principle.
#
# Detection under test: primary checkout <=> `git rev-parse --git-dir` equals
# `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, compared AFTER resolving both to absolute,
# symlink-resolved paths.
#
# On the canonicalization: on git 2.43 invoked from a SUBDIRECTORY, --git-dir
# returns an absolute path while --git-common-dir returns a relative one
# ('../.git'). preflight.sh cds to the repo toplevel before the check, which
# normalizes that away today — so a raw string compare currently behaves the same
# and the subdir arms below pass either way. The canonicalization still matters:
# measured, with that toplevel cd removed, a RAW compare from a subdirectory of
# the primary checkout fails OPEN (exit 0, "cleared for landing") while the
# canonicalized compare still HARD-fails. Since no behavioral arm can distinguish
# the two while the cd stands, Arm 7 asserts the canonicalization structurally —
# same idiom as the 'User-Agent:' grep in test_assert_co_tagging.sh.
#
# Isolation: every arm runs against a throwaway repo built under mktemp -d. The
# test never git-writes into the real checkout and does not care whether the
# developer's tree is clean.

# repo must actually have a `main` branch with a commit.
#
# The fixture must not inherit the developer's/CI image's global git config: a
# global `commit.gpgsign = true` makes the fixture commit try to GPG-sign with the
# throwaway identity and abort (measured: exit 128, "failed to write commit
# object"), and a global `core.hooksPath` — or an `init.templateDir` that seeds
# .git/hooks — runs a foreign pre-commit hook that can veto it (measured: exit 1).
# Either aborts the script before a single assertion runs, so an unrelated
# user-local setting would fail agent-test.sh. All three are neutralized in the
# fixture repo's LOCAL config; the real checkout's config is never touched.
# Arm 8 is the regression guard. A linked worktree shares the common config file,
# so the local settings cover it too — no separate treatment needed.

# --- SLICE-ID-HARDENING: fractional-slice-id plan fixtures --------------------
# The --expect-closed gate (preflight.sh §5) exists to refuse a spawn whose
# declared dependency never closed. Two independent ways it said yes anyway:
#
#   site 4 — the trailing `[^0-9]` matches the `.` in `Slice 39.5`, so ONE
#            UNIT'S CLOSED WITNESS SATISFIES ANOTHER'S: `--expect-closed 39` is
#            cleared by a plan that only ever closed Slice 39.5.
#   [DETERMINE] duty 1 — `${EXPECT_CLOSED}` is interpolated UNESCAPED into an
#            ERE, so with `--expect-closed 39.5` the `.` is a WILDCARD and a
#            plan line reading `Slice 39x5 … CLOSED` clears the gate.
#
# These are separately reachable and a fix for one does not fix the other —
# measured, not reasoned: tightening the trailing class alone still clears
# `Slice 39x5`, and escaping the value alone still clears `Slice 39.5` for
# `--expect-closed 39`. Both classes get their own arms, and the alternation has
# TWO alternatives (`Slice…CLOSED` and `CLOSED…Slice`) which are NOT symmetric —
# the first ends `[^0-9]`, the second `([^0-9]|$)` — so both are graded.
