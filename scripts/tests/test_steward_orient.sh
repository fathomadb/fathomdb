#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/tests/test_steward_orient.sh — recurrence guard for the stateless
# cold-start briefing (DOC-HYGIENE-2 T3a, scripts/steward-orient.sh).
#
# The incident this closes: every Steward cold start re-paid for the same
# orientation, because live state was narrated across a 5-12 file fan-out. The
# briefing collapses that into ONE stateless read. What makes it trustworthy is
# not that it prints something — it is that it CANNOT print a silently partial
# picture, and that it cannot be quietly pinned to a release that has closed.
#
# Predicate under test (see scripts/steward-orient.sh's header for the full
# statement):
#   * output is <= 5120 bytes and NO file is written anywhere — INCLUDING
#     `.git/index`, which `git status` rewrites when it refreshes a stale stat
#     cache (arms 2b-2d);
#   * every load-bearing section is non-empty, or the run HARD-fails naming the
#     section (the documented exemptions are the sections that have a legitimate
#     empty state: open-PR count, orphan checkout dirs, dirty-file count);
#   * the release is derived from the LIVE BOARD FILENAME, never hardcoded;
#   * `<repo-root>-worktrees/` is resolved as a SIBLING of the repo root;
#   * the board-CLOSED predicate is the SHARED one (head -n 15, not head -n 5).
#
# RED-first: the happy path passes on the real repo today, so asserting against
# the real checkout alone would prove nothing (a `true` script would pass it).
# Every failure arm below runs against a purpose-built fixture repo in which the
# fault is deliberately planted, so an arm can only go green because the guard
# actually fired. The real-repo arms are the regression half of the pair.
#
# NON-VACUITY: the suite honours $GATE_UNDER_TEST, so a MUTANT briefing (one
# whose zero-result guard never fires) can be pointed at it. That mutant turns
# arms 3/4/5/8 RED — which is the evidence that a green here is load-bearing
# rather than a script that merely exits 0.
#
# Isolation: fixtures are throwaway git repos under mktemp -d (the briefing does
# `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`, so each fixture needs to BE a repo),
# and each fixture is nested one directory deep so its SIBLING worktrees dir is
# a real, writable path. Nothing here writes into the real checkout.

# --- Arm 2b: .git/index IS BYTE-UNCHANGED, EVEN WITH A STALE STAT CACHE ------
# Arm 2's tree_snapshot PRUNES */.git, so it could never see this: `git status`
# refreshes a stale stat cache and REWRITES .git/index under .git/index.lock.
# That is a repo-metadata write by a script whose stated contract is that it
# writes nothing at all, and it can race a concurrent git command for the lock.
#
# Staling technique: rewrite every tracked file's mtime to a FIXED PAST instant.
# A fixed timestamp (rather than `touch` + sleep) puts the mtime well outside
# git's racily-clean one-second window with no wall-clock cost, so every cache
# entry is unambiguously stat-dirty.
#
# NON-VACUITY, and the RED witness carried inside the suite: a fixture where git
# had nothing to refresh would green this arm no matter what the briefing does.
# So the same staled fixture is COPIED (cp -a preserves the mtimes, so the copy
# is staled identically) and probed with a PLAIN, lock-taking `git status` — the
# exact call the briefing used to make. That copy's index MUST change. Only then
# does "the briefing left the index alone" mean anything.
