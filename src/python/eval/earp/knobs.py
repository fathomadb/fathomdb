"""The knob catalog.

Keyed on **whether a concrete SDK call path exists** -- never on whether a knob
happens to be an `EngineConfig` field. All five engine settings now reach native
open; the slow threshold also retains its post-open setter.

Completeness is asserted by two BOUNDED introspections -- over `EngineConfig`'s
fields and over the search signatures -- each asserting coverage of a known
surface rather than letting reflection define the surface. A hand-maintained
list can under-cover as easily as it can misclassify, and the first revision of
this catalog omitted eight real call paths.
