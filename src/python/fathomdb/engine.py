                (default) is the STRICT view: active-only, non-superseded, and
                valid AT QUERY TIME. ``ReadView(include_out_of_window=True)``
                returns hits whatever their ``[valid_from, valid_until)``
                window; ``ReadView(valid_as_of=t)`` evaluates validity at the
                bound instant ``t``.

                (``include_superseded`` / ``include_inactive``) raise
                ``InvalidArgumentError`` on the search path rather than being
                silently ignored: search hydrates from projection indexes that
                are not version-complete, so they have no truthful answer.
                Use ``read.list`` to enumerate history.

        Returns:
            ``SearchResult`` with RRF-fused (and optionally CE-reranked) hits.
            Each hit carries ``ce_score`` (the CE score for in-pool reranked
            hits, ``None`` otherwise).
