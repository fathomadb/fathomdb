"""The governed ``read.*`` namespace (Slice 30 — G2 / G3; Slice 35 — G4).

Per ``dev/adr/ADR-0.8.0-supersede-five-verb-surface-cap.md`` (B1 ``read.*``), this
module exposes the governed read verbs beside ``admin``:

* ``read.get`` / ``read.get_many`` — active-only point lookup by ``logical_id``
  (active = ``superseded_at IS NULL``). Not-found is a normal ``None`` (a typed
  ``NotFound`` class is reserved for a later slice), never an exception.
* ``read.collection`` / ``read.mutations`` — paginated op-store read-back over
  ``operational_mutations`` with a MANDATORY ``limit`` + ``after_id`` cursor.
* ``read.list`` (G4 / Slice 35) — list active ``canonical_nodes`` of a given
  ``kind``, optionally filtered by a list of ``Predicate`` dicts (AND-combined),
  up to ``limit`` rows. Compiles to parameterized ``json_extract`` over the
  allowlisted path set (injection-safe per ADR D-F4).
* ``read.projection_status`` (0.8.22 Slice 22) — pure current dense-runtime
  status for every declared projection; distinct from the configuration-facing
  ``read.projections`` result.

The retrieval verbs use the native binding's ReaderWorkerPool DEFERRED-tx
path. ``read.projections`` and ``read.projection_status`` are instead pure
introspection queries through the ordinarily opened engine and may briefly take
its connection lock. Neither introspection query writes, configures, or
schedules work, but neither promises a separately opened read-only SQLite mode.
This module exposes the typed Python signatures and converts native rows to the
public dataclasses in ``fathomdb.types``.
