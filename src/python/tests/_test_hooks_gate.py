"""Pure decision logic for the dev-only `test-hooks` binding gate (TC-27).

`pyproject.toml [tool.maturin] features` deliberately ships only the
release feature set, so an editable install built by the documented
`pip install -e 'src/python[dev]'` has NO `test-hooks` surface
(`Engine._write_vector_for_test`, `force_panic_for_test`, ...). A handful
of tests need it.

`conftest.py` may rebuild the binding with `maturin develop`, but that
command **rebinds the active virtualenv to the source tree it is run
from**. Firing it unattended from an agent worktree would silently
repoint every other consumer of a SHARED `.venv` at unreviewed code —
that is TC-27.

The policy is therefore a three-way decision, kept here as a **pure
function** so it is unit-testable without a binding, a venv, or a
subprocess (see `test_test_hooks_gate.py`):

* ``PROCEED``  — nothing to do (hooks present, or not a source checkout).
* ``REBUILD``  — a rebuild is both authorized and safe; run it.
* ``DEGRADED`` — hooks are missing and a rebuild is not authorized/not
  safe. The suite still runs; the tests that need the hook surface are
  SKIPPED with `reason`, never silently passed.
* ``CONTRADICTORY`` — the environment both requests and forbids a
  rebuild. A configuration error; raise.

`DEGRADED` is what keeps the default `pytest` path green-but-honest: a
clean editable checkout collects and runs, and the hook-dependent tests
report as real skips carrying `reason`.
