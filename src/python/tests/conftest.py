"""Shared pytest fixtures for the FathomDB Python SDK test suite.

Phase 11a wires the PyO3 binding to a real `fathomdb-engine`; each
test now needs a unique database path (the engine acquires an
exclusive file lock, so reusing one path across tests in the same
process would surface as `DatabaseLockedError`). `db_path` yields a
fresh per-test `Path` under pytest's `tmp_path` fixture.

EU-6 FIX-1 / 0.8.9.2: rebuild the editable binding with the dev-only
`test-hooks` Cargo feature before any test module is imported —
`pyproject.toml [tool.maturin] features` ships only `default-embedder`
(parity with the released wheel), so without this `Engine._write_vector_for_test`
and friends are missing and tests like `test_use_default_embedder.py`,
`test_ffi_safety.py`, the AC-067 force-panic probe, etc. break.

That rebuild is gated: see `_test_hooks_gate.py` for the policy (TC-27) and
`_ensure_test_hooks_binding` below for how the observations are gathered. When
the gate returns DEGRADED the suite still collects and runs; only the tests
marked `@pytest.mark.requires_test_hooks` are skipped, with the gate's reason
attached, plus a banner in the pytest report header.

When a rebuild IS authorized it runs at conftest IMPORT time (module level
below), NOT as a session-scoped fixture. A fixture runs during test *setup*,
which is too late: a test module that imports the extension during *collection*
dlopen()s the stale `.so`, and a later `maturin develop` cannot be re-imported
in the same process. conftest.py top-level code is the earliest hook that still
runs before sibling test modules are collected. An ordinary developer run may
short-circuit when the hooks are already present. An explicitly authorized
gate run never does: it rebuilds from the current checkout and prints a
module-path/digest receipt so candidate provenance is auditable.
