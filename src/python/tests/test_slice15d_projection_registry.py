    """0.8.20 Slice 23 (``R-20-SV``) — **the UPGRADE path**, the one a real
    consumer database is actually on.

    Databases that declared ``fts``/``vector`` without the ``searchable`` role
    while the engine ACCEPTED it still exist. This slice must not make them
    unreadable. ``read.projections`` is a pure read and rejects nothing, so the
    legacy row is reported **verbatim** — but feeding that output straight back
    into ``configure_projections`` (the shipped fix-4 read→configure round-trip)
    now RAISES ``WriteValidationError``.

    That asymmetry is the honest, documented consequence of the HITL ruling
    (2026-07-24, ``dev/plans/plan-0.8.20.md`` §11 item 4, option **(b)**): for
    the legacy population the round-trip is broken BY DESIGN, and the remedy is
    to ADD the ``searchable`` role (asserted here) or to name the projection in
    ``drop``.

    X1 parity twin of the Rust
    ``a_legacy_registry_row_reads_back_verbatim_but_no_longer_re_applies``
    (``slice23_spec_validation_reject.rs``) and the TS
    ``R-20-SV — a LEGACY registry row reads back verbatim but no longer
    re-applies``. Same seed, same three oracles, same semantics — deliberately
