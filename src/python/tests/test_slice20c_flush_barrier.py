"""X1 SDK parity — 0.8.20 Slice 20c (R-20-DR remainder): ``drain`` is the
flush-to-readiness barrier (``api-surface.md`` **C4**).

Drives the barrier through the PyO3 binding by EXECUTION, not symbol presence.
Mirrors ``src/rust/crates/fathomdb-engine/tests/slice20c_flush_barrier.rs`` and
the TS suite ``src/ts/tests/slice20c-flush-barrier.test.ts`` (Py ≡ TS, R-X-1).

The pinned invariant:

    ``engine.drain()`` returning ⟹ ``vector_dense_readiness == "ready"``
    AND every vector-eligible row has its vector row AT REST.

**Why the raw-table assertion is load-bearing.** A harness that only reads
readiness back PASSES against the defect: before this slice,
``configure_projections`` never enrolled the kind, so ``drain()`` returned
immediately and readiness read ``"ready"`` with ZERO vectors and nothing that
would ever create them. ``sqlite3`` is used purely as a READ oracle
(``mode=ro``, never ``immutable=1``, so committed WAL frames are visible).

These tests need a LIVE embedder (``use_default_embedder=True``) because the
dense arm is what is being flushed; they honour the standing
``FATHOMDB_SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS`` guard, exactly as ``test_use_default_embedder``
does.

ZERO net-new governed commands: this rides the already-governed
``Engine.configure_projections`` / ``read.projections`` verbs plus the shipped
``Engine.drain`` INSTRUMENTATION method (TC-55, steward seq-110).

    durable: once an embedder-backed session has enrolled ``doc``, every later
    session sees the enrolment. Reopening with no embedder and writing that kind
    therefore still enqueues. At baseline the worker exhausted its retry ladder
    against the absent embedder and recorded an ``EmbedderNotConfiguredError``
    ``'failed'`` terminal plus a ``projection_failures`` audit row — and since no
    path reopens a ``'failed'`` terminal, reopening WITH an embedder left that
    write PERMANENTLY unembedded while readiness reported ``"ready"``.

    Three sessions, no re-apply and no second write: the ORDINARY scheduler is
    the whole recovery path.

    The CONSUMER-VISIBLE consequence is asserted here on purpose, so it cannot
    change back silently: with no usable dense runtime, readiness reads
    ``"unavailable"`` regardless of outstanding work. The pending row remains
    recoverable and ``drain`` returns immediate typed
    ``EmbedderRequiredError`` rather than retrying into a scheduler timeout or
    recording a failed terminal.
