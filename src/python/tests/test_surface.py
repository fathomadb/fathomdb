"""Public surface assertions for the Python SDK.

Binds AC-074 (REQ-053): governed SDK surface — a curated allowlist with
cross-binding parity, a permanent recovery-name denylist, and the typed /
no-raw-SQL boundary. (AC-057a's verb-count scope cap is superseded by AC-074;
the surface is now governed-but-open, not capped.)

Pins the governed-surface allowlist (membership, not a count), the
engine-attached instrumentation methods, the keyword vs EngineConfig forms of
`Engine.open`, and the soft-fallback record shape per `dev/interfaces/python.md`
and `dev/design/bindings.md` § 1 / § 3.
