//! **FathomDB embedder API** — the semver-stable trait contract for embedder
//! plugins.
//!
//! This crate is the seam between FathomDB and whatever produces vectors. It
//! contains a trait, an identity struct and an error type, and nothing else: it
//! deliberately pulls in no model runtime, so implementing it costs you no
//! dependency on ours.
//!
//! Implement `Embedder` to plug your own model in. `EmbedderIdentity`
//! (`name` + `revision` + `dimension`) is the contract that keeps stored
//! vectors interpretable: the engine records it on first configure and refuses
//! to reopen a database under a different identity, because vector identity
//! belongs to the embedder and silently re-embedding under a new model would
//! corrupt retrieval.
//!
//! # Versioned independently (Axis E)
//!
//! This crate does **not** move in lockstep with the rest of the workspace.
//! Bumping a FathomDB binding does not force a bump here, which is what
//! decouples embedder-protocol stability from FathomDB's release cadence. Treat
//! any change to the trait as a breaking change for every implementor.
//!
//! For the built-in implementation, see the `fathomdb-embedder` crate; to use
//! FathomDB itself, see the `fathomdb` facade crate.
