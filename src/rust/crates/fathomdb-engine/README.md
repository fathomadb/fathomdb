# fathomdb-engine

The core of **FathomDB** — a local-first, embedded retrieval engine for application and agent
workloads. Storage, migrations, ingest, projection maintenance and hybrid query all live here.

> Most Rust applications should depend on the [`fathomdb`](https://crates.io/crates/fathomdb) facade
> crate instead, which re-exports this crate's public surface behind a single import path. Depend on
> `fathomdb-engine` directly when you need its Cargo features (embedder backends, GPU acceleration)
> or are building another binding on top of it.

## Status: pre-1.0, beta

The 0.8.x line is under active development. The public surface can change between minor releases,
and scale/stability guarantees are staged for 0.9.x and later.

## What it is

A single-file SQLite database (bundled `rusqlite`, plus the `sqlite-vec` extension) with an engine
process model layered on top:

- **Canonical rows are the source of truth.** Callers write nodes and edges; the engine owns every
  derived structure.
- **Projections are engine-owned and declarative.** `configure_projections` diffs a caller's
  declaration against the durable registry and backfills the difference. FTS5 and filterable
  projections build in the same transaction; vector and rankable targets are deferred to a
  background scheduler.
- **Retrieval is hybrid.** FTS5 lexical search and `sqlite-vec` dense retrieval are fused, with
  optional cross-encoder reranking, an optional graph-expansion arm, and a typed soft-fallback
  report when a branch cannot contribute.
- **Provenance is mandatory.** Every canonical row carries a `SourceId`, which is what makes
  `erase_source` able to erase it — including its FTS, vector and secondary-index shadows — at rest.
- **Records have a lifecycle.** `transition` and `purge` move and hard-erase governed nodes;
  `ReadView` selects existence and world-time validity for the read verbs.

## Install

```bash
cargo add fathomdb-engine
```

## Cargo features

| Feature | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `operator` | Un-gates the operator / recovery seam (`rebuild_*`, `excise_source`, `dump_*`, `trace_source_ref`, `truncate_wal`, `verify_embedder`, `check_integrity`, `safe_export`, `recompute_mean`). A gate, not a behaviour switch. |
| `default-embedder` | Lets the engine materialise its pinned default embedder at open time. Weights are fetched on first use and cached under `~/.cache/fathomdb/embedders/`. Without the feature, asking for the default embedder returns a typed error rather than touching the network. |
| `default-reranker` | Enables the built-in cross-encoder reranker. |
| `embed-cuda` / `embed-metal` | GPU acceleration for embedding (opt in at build time, select at runtime with `FATHOMDB_EMBED_DEVICE`). |
| `rerank-cuda` / `rerank-metal` | GPU acceleration for the reranker (`FATHOMDB_RERANK_DEVICE`). |

Defaults are empty: a plain `cargo add fathomdb-engine` pulls no model runtime and performs no
network access.
