//! Concurrent reader/writer test that pins the read-after-write cursor
//! invariant from `dev/design/engine.md` § Cursor contract and AC-059b /
//! REQ-013 / REQ-055.
//!
//! Invariant under test: the number of canonical rows visible to a
//! `search` MUST be ≤ the search's reported `projection_cursor`. Because
//! every committed write advances the engine cursor by exactly one and
//! inserts exactly one canonical row in this fixture, the row count the
//! search returned is a lower bound on "how many writes the reader's
//! snapshot saw"; that value can never exceed the cursor the reader
//! also returned without violating the cursor contract.
//!
//! Failure mode under test: the engine loads `next_cursor` from the
//! writer-side atomic before the reader connection runs its query; a
//! writer commit between those two events appears in the reader's WAL
//! snapshot but not in the reported cursor.
//!
//! Bounded operationally: 1,000 search calls, a 60 s anti-hang fuse (not a
//! product SLA), and a throttled writer.
//!
//! Runtime-budget category: long-run only (~1000-iteration race fixture).
//! `agent-verify.sh` skips this test entirely for runtime budget; the
//! ~1000-iteration race fixture is exercised only by `scripts/check.sh`
//! with `AGENT_LONG=1`. There is no smoke variant — the AC-059b evidence
//! comes exclusively from the long-run gate.
