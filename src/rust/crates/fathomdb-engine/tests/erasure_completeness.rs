//! 0.8.20 Slice 5b — erasure completeness beyond the row-owned projection
//! registry: WAL bytes at rest (R-20-E5), telemetry-sink selective redaction
//! (R-20-E6), op-store record erasure (R-20-E7) and erasure-audit durability
//! (design `0.8.20-slice0-erasure-design.md` §2 defect D-A / §4 item 9a).
//!
//! **Test-design contract (design §3).**
//!
//! * **Rule 1** — erasure witnesses assert on RAW state, never via `search()`.
//! * **Rule 3 (this file's core constraint)** — the WAL requirement is a claim
//!   about **bytes at rest**. `erasure_wal_bytes_absent` therefore scans the raw
//!   `.db` **and** `-wal` files for the erased body as a byte pattern. It must
//!   NOT close the engine before asserting: SQLite checkpoints and unlinks the
//!   `-wal` when the last connection closes, which would make the assertion
//!   vacuously true on the broken code.
