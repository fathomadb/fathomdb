//! 0.8.20 Slice 5 fix-2 (codex §9 [P2]) — the shared `erase_source` /
//! `excise_source` path must DRAIN BEFORE IT FREEZES.
//!
//! **The defect.** `erase_source_shared` froze the projection scanner and only
//! then called `drain`. `drain` → `wait_for_idle` consults
//! `database_has_pending_projection_work`, which reads the DATABASE, not the
//! in-memory queue: a row written moments earlier is "pending" until a worker
//! projects it. But the dispatcher loop parks while `state.frozen` is set, so it
//! can never scan and enqueue that row. The result is a deadlock-by-construction
//! that only ends when `LIFECYCLE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` (30s) elapses, after which
//! the caller gets `EngineError::Scheduler` — for the ordinary first-use
//! sequence "write a vector-indexed row, then erase it".
//!
//! `purge` already carries the correct ordering (settle every pending
//! projection UNFROZEN first, then freeze, then confirm idle, then erase) with a
//! comment naming this exact failure mode. This file pins that the shared source
//! erasure path has it too.
//!
//! **Why the fixture strands work deterministically.** `GatedEmbedder::embed`
//! blocks until the test releases it, so no projection job can complete before
//! the erasure call. The dispatcher can therefore enqueue at most
//! `PROJECTION_INFLIGHT_LIMIT` (2 workers × 16 commit batch = 32) rows before it
//! parks on the in-flight budget; the fixture writes far more than that, so a
//! large remainder is provably still UNSCANNED at the instant `erase_source` is
//! entered. On the broken ordering that remainder is unreachable forever. A
//! fixture that wrote only a row or two would race the dispatcher and could pass
//! on the broken code, which is worthless.
