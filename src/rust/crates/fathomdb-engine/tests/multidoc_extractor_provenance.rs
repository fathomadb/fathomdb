//! 0.8.20 Slice 5 fix-4 — R-20-E2, the **multi-document** arm.
//!
//! Slice 5 made ingest provenance caller-grounded: `resolve_provenance`
//! (`fathomdb-engine/src/lib.rs`) admits the model's `source_doc_id` echo only
//! as a SELECTOR among ids the caller supplied in the same batch, never as a
//! value. Coverage for that change was **single-document only**
//! (`provenance_mandatory::extractor_omitting_source_doc_id_still_excisable`),
//! and a single-document batch is precisely the case where the echo is ignored
//! outright — so nothing exercised the branch that actually demands an echo.
//!
//! That gap shipped a regression: every MULTI-document extractor batch failed
//! with `EngineError::Extractor`, because the extractor protocol never required
//! per-entity attribution and the shipped ELPS harness backfilled
//! `source_doc_id` onto edges only. This file closes the gap from both sides:
//!
//! * the engine's demand is correct and must keep failing loudly
//!   (`multidoc_batch_*_fails_loudly`);
//! * the shipped harness must satisfy that demand
//!   (`elps_live_harness_multidoc_batch_ingests`).
//!
//! **Test-design contract (design §3, Rule 1).** Every provenance witness here
//! asserts on RAW TABLE CONTENTS via direct SQL. Proving provenance through
//! `search()` is invalid — both `search_index_v2` read paths gate on a live
//! `canonical_nodes` row, so such a test passes on broken code.
