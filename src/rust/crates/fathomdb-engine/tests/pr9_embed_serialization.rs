//! PR-9 item 1 — engine-side embed serialization.
//!
//! The projection pool runs `PROJECTION_WORKERS` (2) workers. PR-9 serializes
//! the embed *call* engine-side so the shared `Arc<dyn Embedder>` is invoked
//! by at most one worker at a time, while commit/IO stays parallel.
//!
//! Rationale is SAFETY, not throughput: the engine accepts arbitrary
//! caller-supplied embedders (pyo3 / napi bridges) that are `Sync` only by
//! contract and may not be truly concurrency-safe; serializing engine-side
//! makes the projection robust to them. (Throughput is ~neutral — candle
//! fans every forward onto one process-wide rayon pool, so concurrent
//! forwards share it rather than getting 2x; the PR-9 pre-flight also
//! confirmed concurrent CandleBge embeds neither wedge nor corrupt.)
//!
//! This test proves serialization mechanically with a fast mock embedder
//! that records the maximum number of `embed()` calls in flight at once.
//!
//! RED (no guard): two workers embed concurrently → max in flight == 2.
//! GREEN (guard):  embeds run one at a time   → max in flight == 1.
