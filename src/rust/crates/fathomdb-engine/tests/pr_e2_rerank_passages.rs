//! 0.8.2 Slice E2 — standalone rerank over an arbitrary passage list.
//!
//! Exercises the pure helper
//! `rerank_passages(query, Vec<(id, body, score)>, depth) -> Vec<(id, score)>`
//! that the `fathomdb.rerank` pyo3 binding is a thin wrapper over. Slice 5's
//! `fused_rerank` comparator needs to CE-rerank its OWN in-harness fused
//! (bm25+dense) pool — a pool the engine's `search()` never sees — so the CE
//! must be reachable over a caller-supplied passage list, not only the engine's
//! capped text pool.
//!
//! Runs ONLY under `--features default-reranker` (the whole target is gated in
//! `Cargo.toml`), mirroring `pr_g10_reranker_ce`: the reorder assertion drives
//! the real TinyBERT-L-2 cross-encoder (one gated, sha256-pinned ~17 MB fetch on
//! a cold cache, then cached). The default build skips this target; its
//! soft-fallback identity contract is covered there by `pr_g10_reranker.rs`.
