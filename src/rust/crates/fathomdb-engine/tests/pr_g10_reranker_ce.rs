//! 0.8.2 Slice E1 — the CE reranker actually reranks.
//!
//! Runs ONLY under `--features default-reranker` (the whole target is
//! feature-gated in `Cargo.toml`). It exercises the real TinyBERT-L-2
//! cross-encoder: a `rerank_depth > 0` call over a fused pool where the CE
//! disagrees with the RRF order must REORDER the pool so the
//! genuinely-relevant passage rises above the spuriously top-RRF one.
//!
//! Against the pre-E1 stub (`try_get_loaded() → None`, `score() → 0.0`) the CE
//! path returns `None` → soft-fallback → no reorder → this test FAILS (RED).
//! With the real model loaded it reorders → PASS (GREEN).
//!
//! Loading the model on a cold cache performs ONE gated network fetch of the
//! pinned ~17 MB weights (sha256-verified), then caches under
//! `~/.cache/fathomdb/reranker/`. This is the sanctioned gated download
//! (not a FathomDB-default network call): the default build and the
//! `rerank_depth == 0` path never touch it.
