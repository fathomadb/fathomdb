//! 0.8.0 Slice 5 / G1 — global FTS5 tokenizer-default upgrade recall floor.
//!
//! AC-FTS-tokenizer-floor. The recall floor (>= 0.90) MUST hold on a DB
//! **migrated from the prior `SCHEMA_VERSION` (10)** — not merely on a fresh
//! DB. This pins the no-op-on-existing-DB failure mode RED: if the tokenizer
//! upgrade only affects fresh DBs (i.e. re-tokenization is not wired after the
//! drop+recreate migration), the migrated DB's `search_index` is empty and
//! recall collapses to 0.
//!
//! Deterministic, in-suite (runs every `cargo test` — no network, no
//! `AGENT_LONG`). No mocking of the database: a real engine is opened against a
//! real on-disk SQLite file at each schema version.
