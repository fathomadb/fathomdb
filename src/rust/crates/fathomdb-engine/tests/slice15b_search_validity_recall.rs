//! 0.8.20 Slice 15b fix-3 (R-20-NV) — two codex §9 [P2] correctness findings on
//! the validity-aware search path landed by fix-2.
//!
//! fix-2 made every search hydration site apply the validity predicate. It
//! applied it in the RIGHT PLACE for correctness-of-inclusion (no expired row
//! can leak) but in the WRONG PLACE for correctness-of-RECALL, and it resolved
//! the instant TWICE for a graph-arm query.
//!
//! **F1 — validity must participate BEFORE the vector cutoff.** Slice 35
//! supersedes the original overfetch-and-hydrate treatment: validity is not a
//! native vec0 metadata predicate, so a partition containing an ineligible row
//! declines the entire vector arm before KNN and emits `SoftFallback(Vector)`.
//! The lexical arm then recovers eligible rows with its own pre-limit SQL.
//!
//! `F1` pins both halves of that contract: the isolated vector arm returns no
//! post-filtered candidates and declares its fallback, while ordinary hybrid
//! search still returns the two eligible rows.
//!
//! **F2 — one query, one instant.** For the default view (`valid_as_of ==
//! None`) the graph arm re-resolved *now* instead of reusing the instant
//! already resolved for the vector/text arms. A query that straddles a validity
//! boundary could then have its arms disagree about which side of the boundary
//! they are on, so a boundary-window node's inclusion became a race against the
//! wall clock. R-20-NV requires `:now` to bind ONCE PER QUERY — not per row,
//! and not per arm.
//!
//! `F2` is asserted structurally, by COUNTING CLOCK READS rather than by racing
//! the clock: `clock_reads_for_test()` meters the single function that reads
//! wall time on this path, so "the arms cannot disagree" becomes "the clock was
//! read exactly once". No wall-clock assertion, no sleep, deterministic.
//!
//! Both tests read RAW TABLES to prove they are non-vacuous — a row that was
//! never projected into `vector_default` is also "not returned", which would
//! make F1 pass on entirely broken code.
