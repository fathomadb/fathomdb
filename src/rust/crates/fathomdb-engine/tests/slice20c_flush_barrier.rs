//! 0.8.20 Slice 20c (R-20-DR remainder) — **`drain` is the flush-to-readiness
//! barrier** (`api-surface.md` **C4**), and its *rider*: `drain` is a **barrier**
//! (wait-for-idle), **not** a trigger, so deferred/backfill rows MUST be
//! **enqueued on the same projection runtime `drain` waits on**.
//!
//! Steward ruling `seq-110` (HITL 2026-07-26): TC-55 = INSTRUMENTATION. The
//! barrier ships by REUSING the shipped `drain`, not by minting a governed
//! `flush_embeddings` command — so this suite adds ZERO net-new governed surface.
//!
//! ## The defect these tests close
//!
//! `configure_projections` persists a `searchable→vector` declaration, pushes the
//! name onto `ProjectionDelta::deferred` … and then drops that deferred work on
//! the floor: it never registers the kind in `_fathomdb_vector_kinds`, never
//! rewinds the readiness watermark, and never notifies the projection runtime.
//! Meanwhile `project_canonical_node_row` has already written a PERMANENT
//! `'up_to_date'` terminal for every row whose kind was not vector-registered at
//! write time.
//!
//! Both arms of `connection_has_pending_projection_work` — the ONE predicate
//! shared by `drain` (via `wait_for_idle`) and by `derive_dense_readiness` — key
//! off that terminal and off the `_fathomdb_vector_kinds` join. So on the broken
//! code the sequence *write rows → declare `searchable→vector`* yields
//! `drain() == Ok(())` **immediately** and `dense_readiness == "ready"` while NO
//! vector row exists and nothing will ever create one. That is a **false-ready
//! barrier** and a direct violation of R-20-DR's acceptance signal ("readiness
//! never reports ready with pending embeds").
//!
//! ## Why every assertion reads RAW TABLES
//!
//! A test that only reads readiness back PASSES on the broken code (it reports
//! `ready`, which is what a naive test would assert after a drain). The falsifying
//! oracle is `_fathomdb_vector_rows` + `vector_default` — the vectors at rest.
//!
//! **No Slice 20c schema step.** Re-enqueueing embed work inside ONE live
//! database is runtime reconfiguration, not a cross-version data migration
//! (HITL 2026-07-21, cf. TC-46). Later unrelated migrations do not affect that
//! boundary.
//!
//! ## Known: this suite sometimes reports ~30 s wall time (not a flake)
//!
//! Every assertion still passes; ONE `drain(30_000)` occasionally returns `Ok`
//! only at its deadline. The cause is a PRE-EXISTING missed wakeup in
//! `ProjectionRuntime::wait_for_idle`: it releases the state lock to run
//! `database_has_pending_projection_work` (which opens a fresh connection), and a
//! worker that finishes the LAST job inside that window does its
//! `state_cvar.notify_all()` before the waiter re-acquires. With no further
//! notification the waiter sleeps the whole remaining timeout, then re-probes at
//! the loop top, sees idle, and returns `Ok`. Adding Leg C widened the exposure
//! (two more concurrent engines) but did not create it — `wait_for_idle` is
//! untouched by this slice. Measured: capping the cvar wait at 25 ms removes the
//! stall in 6/6 runs versus ~40 % stalls without. Left unfixed on purpose (fix-1
//! scope is the drop inverse); reported for triage, where the same window is also
//! a SPURIOUS-TIMEOUT risk for callers who pass a short timeout.

// Leg A gave `_fathomdb_vector_kinds` its first governed-call-reachable
// enrolment path (before this slice the only writer for a NODE kind was the
// `#[doc(hidden)]` `configure_vector_kind_for_test` hook). Enrolment with no

// `kind_is_vector_indexed` gate keeps enqueueing embeds and
// `connection_has_pending_projection_work` keeps making `drain` wait — for a
// projection the registry no longer declares.
//
// The inverse is deliberately NON-DESTRUCTIVE. The shipped `drop` arm
// (`clear_attribute_projection` + `remove_projection_row`) has NEVER touched
// vec0, `_fathomdb_vector_rows` or `_fathomdb_vector_kinds`, so "existing
// vectors survive a drop" is already the shipped contract. Un-enrolment removes
// ONE registry row and deletes no embedding, which PRESERVES that contract —
// asserted below rather than assumed.

//
// Both of Slice 20c's enrolment paths enrol off the kind actually present in

// timeout into `EngineError::Scheduler`, and readiness is stuck on `embedding`.
// That is a permanent LIVENESS wedge for the whole workspace — including the
// rows whose kinds ARE commit-able.
