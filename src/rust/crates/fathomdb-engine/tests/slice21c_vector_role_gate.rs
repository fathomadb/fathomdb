//! 0.8.20 Slice 21c (`R-20-CR`, leg 3 / ledger **TC-71**) — **the dense arm is
//! gated on the `searchable` ROLE, not on the bare `vector` sub-object.**
//!
//! ## The defect these tests close
//!
//! `vector_projection_declared` — the corpus-wide "is the dense arm declared?"
//! predicate that gates all three enrolment paths — answered
//! `EXISTS(… WHERE vector_declared = 1)` and never read the `roles` column. So a
//! projection declared `{roles: [filterable], vector: {}}` — a combination the
//! shipped Slice-15d contract documents as **inert but round-trippable**
//! (`vector_subobject_is_stored_not_built`) — turned the dense arm ON in any
//! session with a live embedder: it enrolled the node kinds, backfilled the
//! corpus, and made every later write of those kinds enqueue an embedding.
//!
//! **Severity.** This is wasted embed work plus unexpected vectors at rest for a
//! projection meant to be inert. It is **not** a false-ready and **not** data
//! loss — no reader is wrong, and nothing is deleted. It is pinned here because
//! "declaring `filterable` silently starts embedding your whole corpus" is a
//! surprising, billable side effect of a declaration documented as doing nothing.
//!
//! ## Why the shipped suites do not catch it
//!
//! `slice15d_projection_registry::vector_subobject_is_stored_not_built` opens
//! with plain `Engine::open` — **no embedder** — so every dense-arm path it
//! could have tripped is short-circuited by the `runtime_embedder.is_none()`
//! precondition; it passes **vacuously**. It also declares
//! `{searchable, vector}`, which is legitimately vector-declared, so it never
//! even exercises the offending shape. The only shipped test of the offending
//! shape is TypeScript (`src/ts/tests/slice15d-projection-registry.test.ts`,
//! "vector sub-object round-trips"), and it likewise opens without an embedder
//! and asserts round-trip fidelity only, never at-rest inertness.
//!
//! Every test below therefore opens with a **live** [`CountingEmbedder`] and
//! asserts on RAW TABLES (`_fathomdb_vector_kinds`, `_fathomdb_vector_rows`,
//! `vector_default`) plus the embedder's call count. A returned
//! [`fathomdb_engine::ProjectionDelta`] is NOT a falsifying oracle here: the
//! delta is identical before and after the fix (that is the point of the
//! round-trip pin below).
//!
//! ## The three gated paths, and the fourth pin
//!
//! `vector_projection_declared` has exactly four call sites, covering three
//! paths; each has a test here:
//!
//! - **(a) forward backfill** — `enqueue_declared_vector_backfill`'s entry guard
//!   and `apply_projection_config`'s `vector_declared_after` fork:
//!   [`a_filterable_vector_declaration_backfills_nothing_and_embeds_nothing`].
//! - **(b) drop inverse** — the `vector_declared_before` snapshot, which decides
//!   whether `unenrol_registry_vector_node_kinds` fires. Making the predicate
//!   role-aware flips the forward AND inverse arms at once, so the demotion
//!   `{searchable, vector}` → `{filterable, vector}` must now UN-ENROL:
//!   [`demoting_a_searchable_vector_projection_to_filterable_un_enrols_the_kind`]
//!   and [`dropping_the_last_searchable_vector_projection_un_enrols_past_an_inert_sibling`].
//! - **(c) late enrolment** — `Engine::vector_kind_needs_enrolment`, the write
//!   path's fourth guard:
//!   [`a_write_under_a_filterable_vector_declaration_enqueues_no_embedding`].
//!
//! And the boundary that stops the fix from over-reaching: the projection must
//! become INERT, not DISAPPEAR —
//! [`a_filterable_vector_declaration_round_trips_verbatim_without_an_embedder`]
//! plus the round-trip assertions inside path (a)'s test.
//!
//! ## 0.8.20 Slice 23 (`R-20-SV`) — the ROUTE changed; the coverage did not
//!
//! The HITL ruled on 2026-07-24 that this suite's shape is an INVALID SPEC, and
//! Slice 23 rejects it with `EngineError::WriteValidation`. The shape is
//! therefore no longer constructible through `configure_projections` — but it is
//! still at rest in every database that declared it while the engine accepted
//! it, which is the population TC-71 exists for. Each test below now builds that
//! state through the documented legacy back door
//! ([`declare_legacy_filterable_vector`]) and asserts the reject in place on the
//! way past. **Every oracle is unchanged**; nothing here was deleted or
//! weakened.
