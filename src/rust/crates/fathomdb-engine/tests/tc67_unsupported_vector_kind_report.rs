//! 0.8.20 Slice 22 (`R-20-VC`, leg 1 / ledger **TC-67**) — **declaring a
//! `searchable→vector` projection over a kind the vector writer can never commit
//! must REPORT, not fall silent.**
//!
//! ## The silence these tests close
//!
//! Slice 20c fix-2 restricted vector enrolment to the kinds `resolve_source_type`
//! maps (`email, article, paper, meeting, note, todo, doc, edge_fact`), because
//! enrolling any other kind is a permanent liveness wedge — the scheduler picks
//! the row up, `commit_projection_outcomes` fails before recording a terminal,
//! and `drain` burns its whole timeout forever. That fix is CORRECT and is not
//! touched here. What it left behind is a hole in the *reporting*:
//!
//! ```text
//! for kind in kinds.iter().filter(|kind| kind_is_vector_committable(kind)) {
//!     register_vector_kind(tx, kind)?;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A kind outside the vocabulary is dropped by that filter with **no enrolment,
//! no error, and nothing recorded**. Meanwhile the registry row IS persisted and
//! the projection's name IS pushed onto `ProjectionDelta::deferred`. So the
//! caller is told "deferred" and **cannot distinguish**:
//!
//! - *transient* — waiting on the embedder (Q6a graceful-absent, or an embed
//!   still in flight); it will get vectors later; from
//! - *permanent* — this kind is outside the locked Pack-1 partition-key
//!   vocabulary and will **never** get a vector, in this or any future session.
//!
//! Those two states are reported with the SAME `deferred` entry, which is the
//! defect. Per the HITL ruling the remedy is option **(c) REPORT**: the
//! `resolve_source_type` vocabulary is **NOT grown** and the Pack-1 D3
//! partition-key lock (`dev/design/0.7.0-vector-quant-pack1.md`) is **NOT
//! touched** — a new, typed, additive field on the delta carries the fact.
//!
//! ## What this suite pins
//!
//! 1. the unsupported kinds ARE reported, by kind, sorted and de-duplicated
//!    ([`an_uncommittable_kind_is_reported_not_silently_dropped`]);
//! 2. **readiness semantics are UNCHANGED** — an un-enrolled kind is not
//!    outstanding work, so `dense_readiness` still reads `ready` and `drain`
//!    still returns promptly. The report is additive INFORMATION, never a
//!    readiness change and never an error
//!    ([`readiness_semantics_are_unchanged_by_the_report`]);
//! 3. the report is EMPTY, not absent, when there is nothing to report
//!    ([`a_corpus_of_only_supported_kinds_reports_an_empty_list_not_absent`]);
//! 4. the report is INDEPENDENT of whether this session has an embedder, so a
//!    no-embedder session is not told a kind is permanently unsupported merely
//!    because nothing can embed right now — and conversely the permanent fact is
//!    still reported there
//!    ([`the_report_is_the_same_without_an_embedder_and_is_not_the_deferral`]);
//! 5. it is a STATE report, not a diff — an idempotent re-apply still carries it
//!    ([`the_report_is_state_not_diff_so_an_idempotent_reapply_still_carries_it`]),
//!    which is also the documented way to refresh the declare-time residual;
//! 6. it is scoped to the dense arm — no `searchable→vector` declaration, no
//!    report ([`no_vector_declaration_means_no_report`]);
//! 7. it does not break the shipped `read.projections` → `configure_projections`
//!    round-trip ([`the_read_configure_round_trip_still_holds`]).
//!
//! `"invoice"` is the established non-committable fixture kind
//! (`slice20c_flush_barrier` Leg D); `"entity"` is added because it is the
//! concrete consumer case — Memex's entity kinds sit outside the locked
//! vocabulary, and TC-67 exists so that consumer learns those rows get FTS and
//! lexical search but will never get vectors.
