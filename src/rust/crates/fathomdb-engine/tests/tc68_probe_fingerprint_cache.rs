//! 0.8.20 Slice 22 (R-20-VC) **TC-68** — the 0.8.18 vector-equivalence probe is
//! CACHED against an embedder-identity fingerprint, so `Engine::open` stops
//! paying the 45-probe re-embed on every single open.
//!
//! Authority: `dev/plans/plan-0.8.20.md` §3 row `R-20-VC` (TC-68) and
//! `dev/design/0.8.20-tc68-equivalence-probe-fingerprint-cache.md`. The probe
//! itself is `dev/design/0.8.18-slice-5-vector-equivalence-probe.md` +
//! `dev/adr/ADR-0.8.18-vector-equivalence-self-check.md` (ACCEPTED, HITL-signed).
//!
//! ## MEASURED baseline (this file's characterization tests pin it)
//!
//! Taken at `94bb33ef` with a counting embedder, snapshotting `embed` calls
//! across `Engine::open`:
//!
//! | workspace state                   | open 1 | open 2 | open 3 |
//! |-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
//! | zero enrolled vector kinds        | 0      | 0      | —      |
//! | ONE enrolled kind                 | **90** | **45** | **45** |
//! | SIX enrolled kinds                | **90** | **45** | **45** |
//!
//! So both figures in circulation are true, of different opens: **90** is the
//! one-time POPULATION open (45 embeds to persist the baseline + 45 more for the
//! fix-2 "confirm the just-written baseline" check), and **45** is EVERY open
//! thereafter, forever. Cost is already independent of the enrolled-kind count
//! (the probe gate is `SELECT EXISTS(...)`, not a count, and the probe body never
//! iterates kinds) — so a test that varies the kind count is VACUOUS. The real
//! cost is the per-open 45, and that is what TC-68 removes.
//!
//! ## The three acceptance points
//!
//! 1. a second/subsequent open whose fingerprint is UNCHANGED does **zero** probe
//!    embeds;
//! 2. an open whose fingerprint CHANGED re-runs the **full** probe;
//! 3. fail-SAFE (`R-VEQ-4`, HITL-signed) is untouched — an unreadable/garbled
//!    cache falls back to RUNNING the probe (never to trusting it), and a
//!    divergence still yields `dense_disabled`.
//!
//! ## The residual, asserted rather than buried
//!
//! Caching against a fingerprint means SAME-identity backend drift (candle
//! CPU↔CUDA, a library/driver change) is no longer caught on every open. That is
//! the ruled trade, and
//! `residual_same_identity_backend_drift_is_not_caught_on_a_cached_open` states it
//! as an executable fact.
//!
//! ## fix-1 — the THREAT MODEL, measured rather than asserted
//!
//! codex §9 round 2 raised a `[P1]`: the cached marker is a SHA-256 over
//! deterministic, publicly derivable DB and build inputs, so an actor with write
//! access to the SQLite file can compute the current digest, write it into
//! `_fathomdb_open_state`, and force the early `Ok(())` before the 45-probe
//! verification runs. That is true, and
//! `a_marker_matching_the_current_state_serves_a_drifted_backend` proves it.
//!
//! `a_forged_stored_baseline_defeats_the_probe_even_when_it_fully_runs` shows the
//! SAME actor defeats the SAME arm through the **pre-slice** path — forge
//! `_fathomdb_embed_probe.reference_vec` to the drifted backend's own output and
//! the probe runs all 45 embeds and PASSES. The check body exercised there is
//! byte-identical to the one shipped at the slice baseline `fe85337f` (the TC-68
//! diff adds only the cache gate and the recording call), and the marker is
//! deleted first so the cache demonstrably plays no part.
//!
//! So the equivalence probe is a **correctness self-check against backend drift,
//! not tamper evidence** — it never was, and there is no secret in an embedded
//! local-first engine with which to make the marker unforgeable.
//!
//! ## fix-2 — the same actor, but NOT the same cost
//!
//! fix-1 concluded from the pair above that "the cache adds no new attack surface".
//! The codex re-review rejected that and was right: forging the marker needs only a
//! publicly computable digest (usually the one already in the row), while
//! re-baselining needs the target backend's 45 exact embeddings encoded into every
//! row — a materially higher bar. **The cache IS a cheaper bypass.** The claim is
//! struck; see §8.4 of the design note.
//!
//! What bounds the finding is the ruled residual, not the marker:
//! `residual_same_identity_backend_drift_is_not_caught_on_a_cached_open` shows an
//! **honestly recorded** marker already serves a drifted backend with NO forgery at
//! all, so forgery adds capability only where no valid marker exists for the current
//! fingerprint (§8.5). And it is bounded in time too:
//! `a_replayed_verdict_marker_is_defeated_by_a_mutated_baseline` and
//! `a_replayed_verdict_marker_is_defeated_by_a_rewritten_pinned_mean` show a known
//! digest stops working at the next change to any fingerprint input.

// The finding is correct as stated: a writer who can compute the current digest
// forces the probe to be skipped. These four tests establish what that is worth —
// that the SAME actor already defeated the SAME arm before the cache existed, and
// that a known digest expires at the next change to any fingerprint input.
//
// fix-2: same actor, NOT same cost — the marker route is the cheaper one, and that
// concession is §8.4 of the design note. The bound on the finding is the ruled
// residual above, not these tests.

/// **THE HYPOTHESIS TEST.** Is the pre-slice design tamper-evident against a hostile
/// writer? No — and this is the measurement that says so.
///
/// **fix-2 — read the scope of this measurement carefully.** It establishes that the
/// same actor had a route that defeats the probe while it runs in full. It does NOT
/// establish that the two routes cost the same: this one needs the drifted backend's
/// 45 exact embeddings, the marker route needs a publicly computable digest. fix-1
/// drew "the cache adds no new attack surface" from this test; that inference was
/// wrong and is struck (§8.4).
///
/// The 0.8.18 probe re-embeds the 45 committed probes and compares them to the
/// STORED references. Those references live in an ordinary table in the same file.
/// An actor with write access re-baselines them to their drifted backend's own
/// output — same ordinals, same texts, same identity triple, same blob lengths, so
/// the fix-2 completeness validation sees nothing — and the probe then verifies the
/// drifted backend against itself and PASSES.
///
/// The cache is removed from the picture entirely: the marker is DELETED before
/// the open, and the test asserts all 45 embeds actually happen. What runs is the
/// check body as shipped at the slice baseline `fe85337f` (the TC-68 diff over that
/// function adds only the cache gate and the `record_probe_verification` call).
///
/// The control leg proves the forgery is what does it: the identical drifted
/// backend against an UN-forged baseline is caught and refuses dense.
