//! 0.8.20 Slice 21 fix-1 (codex §9 round 1 `[P2]`, ledger **TC-71**) —
//! **reconcile the vector kinds an ALREADY-AFFECTED database enrolled before the
//! role gate landed.**
//!
//! ## The defect these tests close
//!
//! Slice 21c made `vector_projection_declared` require the `searchable` ROLE, so
//! a `{roles: [filterable], vector: {}}` declaration no longer turns the dense
//! arm on. That closes the FORWARD doors only. For a database that already ran
//! the old code, `_fathomdb_vector_kinds` ALREADY contains the node kinds, and
//! nothing on the upgrade path removes them:
//!
//! - `Engine::vector_kind_needs_enrolment` returns early (`Ok(false)`) as soon as
//!   `kind_is_vector_indexed` is true, so it never reaches the new role-aware
//!   predicate — the fix cannot see an existing registration;
//! - `project_canonical_node_row` gates the embed enqueue SOLELY on registry
//!   membership (`targets.vector && kind_is_vector_indexed(..)`), never on
//!   `vector_projection_declared`.
//!
//! So upgrading did **not** stop the billable, unexpected embeddings for exactly
//! the population TC-71 was raised for. The only un-enrol path
//! (`unenrol_registry_vector_node_kinds`) fires inside `apply_projection_config`
//! on the `declared_before && !declared_after` edge, which a user who never calls
//! `configure_projections` again never reaches.
//!
//! ## The fix, and the trap it must not fall into
//!
//! A boot-time reconciliation un-enrols the node kinds — but ONLY when the
//! registry demonstrably governs the dense arm and demonstrably declares no
//! `searchable→vector` projection. All three of:
//!
//!   1. `_fathomdb_projection_registry` EXISTS; and
//!   2. at least one row has `vector_declared = 1` (someone actually wrote a
//!      `vector` sub-object — this is what identifies the affected population);
//!      and
//!   3. NO projection satisfies `StoredProjection::wants_vector`.
//!
//! Condition 2 is load-bearing and is what
//! [`a_registry_with_no_vector_subobject_leaves_a_pre_registry_enrolment_untouched`]
//! guards. The naive rule "`!vector_projection_declared` ⇒ un-enrol" would fire
//! on an empty registry and silently switch off a dense arm enrolled by other
//! means. Slice 35 now rejects a current-schema database whose registry table
//! was removed, so that corrupt shape is tested as a fail-closed case rather
//! than as a boot-time no-op.
//!
//! `'edge_fact'` is auto-registered by `project_canonical_edge_row` (G11),
//! independently of the projection registry, and must never be un-enrolled —
//! pinned in every reconciling case here.
//!
//! Every test opens with a **live** `CountingEmbedder` and asserts on RAW TABLES
//! (`_fathomdb_vector_kinds`, `_fathomdb_vector_rows`, `vector_default`) plus the
//! embedder's call count. No returned struct is a falsifying oracle for "no
//! embedding happened".
