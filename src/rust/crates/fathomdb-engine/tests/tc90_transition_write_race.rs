//! 0.8.20 Slice 23 (R-20-SV, leg 2) — **TC-90 characterization harness.**
//!
//! ## What this file is
//!
//! At the 0.8.20 baseline, TC-90 (ledger `seq-128`, p1, `area: engine`) established
//! that [`Engine::transition`] had the SAME shape TC-57 fixed in `commit_batch`:
//! it read before it wrote inside a rusqlite `BEGIN DEFERRED` transaction, so the
//! transaction had to promote a read lock while another writer held the WAL lock.
//!
//! ## Slice 30 resolution (0.8.25)
//!
//! The current [`Engine::transition`] opens `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` before lifecycle or
//! dependency-closure reads. The historical raw-SQL pin below remains evidence of
//! the old failure mechanism; the real-Engine pin now proves the resolved contract:
//! under a synchronized 250 ms held write lock, transition waits and succeeds.
//! The written historical characterization remains
//! `dev/design/0.8.20-tc90-tc91-characterization.md`.
//!
//! ## Historical shape — quoted from `lib.rs` at `94f09d7d`
//!
//! ```text
//! lib.rs:8221   let tx = connection.transaction()...;                  // BEGIN DEFERRED
//! lib.rs:8227   let current: Option<(String, i64, String)> = tx.query_row(
//! lib.rs:8229       "SELECT state, write_cursor, body FROM canonical_nodes \
//! lib.rs:8230        WHERE logical_id = ?1 AND superseded_at IS NULL", ...)   // READ  -> read lock
//! lib.rs:8258   tx.execute(
//! lib.rs:8259       "UPDATE canonical_nodes SET state = ?1, reason = ?2 \
//! lib.rs:8260        WHERE logical_id = ?3 AND superseded_at IS NULL", ...)   // WRITE -> PROMOTE
//! ```
//!
//! That is structurally identical to `commit_batch`'s pre-TC-57-fix shape. What
//! differs is the MITIGATION already present at the call site, and it is that
//! difference — not the transaction shape — that the two loop arms measure.
//!
//! ## The two mitigations baseline `transition` had and `commit_batch` did not
//!
//! 1. **`lib.rs:8217` — `self.drain(LIFECYCLE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS)?` before the
//!    transaction.** Waits for `active_jobs == 0 && queued_jobs == 0` AND for the
//!    on-disk `database_has_pending_projection_work` predicate to go false
//!    (`lib.rs:1246-1273`), so at the instant `drain` returns there is no worker
//!    commit in flight and none pending.
//! 2. **`lib.rs:8219` — `self.connection.lock()`.** `write_inner` takes the SAME
//!    mutex (`lib.rs:5051`), so no in-process `Engine::write` can commit — and
//!    therefore no new projection job can be enqueued — while `transition` holds
//!    its transaction open.
//!
//! Neither is present in `commit_batch`. Together they mean the in-process race
//! window is NOT "the whole transaction" (as it was for TC-57) but only the gap
//! between `drain` returning and the connection mutex being acquired: a competing
//! `Engine::write` that wins the mutex in that gap can commit, wake the
//! dispatcher, and have a worker holding the write lock by the time `transition`
//! promotes.
//!
//! ## MEASURED at `94f09d7d` — the window is real, and it is NARROW
//!
//! Two independent sessions of 10 runs per arm; every arm replicated exactly.
//!
//! | arm | writers x burst | pace | embed | runs | failed |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | [`tc90_repro_transition_loop_races_projection_worker`] | 1 x 1 | 3 ms | 2 ms | 20 | **0/20** |
//! | [`tc90_control_transition_loop_without_second_writer`] | 1 x 1 | 3 ms | — | 20 | **0/20** |
//! | [`tc90_stress_transition_loop_under_saturating_burst_load`] | 2 x 24 | 1 ms | 0 ms | 20 | **20/20** |
//! | [`tc90_stress_control_without_second_writer`] | 2 x 24 | 1 ms | — | 20 | **0/20** |
//!
//! The TC-57-shaped paced arm does **not** reproduce: at a 2 ms embed the worker
//! cannot reach its commit inside the microseconds `transition` spends between
//! acquiring the connection mutex and promoting. **The stress arm reproduces
//! 10/10** — against a control that is **0/10** with the identical load.
//!
//! **Quote the reproduction rate, not the failure rate.** Two independent
//! sessions on the same commit and machine gave per-run means of **5.9** and
//! **3.8** failures per 40 transitions; the 10/10 reproduction replicated, the
//! rate did not. Pooled over N = 20 the range is **1–10 per 40** (≈ 2.5 %–25 %).
//! In all 20 runs: `attempted == 40`, `truncated == false`, zero `Scheduler` and
//! zero other variants — and since codex §9 round 4 those are **asserted**
//! ([`assert_protocol_ran`]), not merely reported.
//!
//! **Had only the paced arm been run, this file would have reported a clean,
//! well-measured, and completely FALSE NEGATIVE.** The knob that decided it is
//! one field, [`ArmConfig::embed_delay_ms`]. The consequence is a finding about
//! the *protocol*, not the engine: **the TC-57 template was INSUFFICIENT — it
//! needed a stress arm**, because `commit_batch` had no mitigations while
//! `transition` has two, which narrow the window to microseconds a paced repro
//! cannot hit. An agent told to "follow the TC-57 template" and nothing else
//! would conclude [`Engine::transition`] is clean, and would be wrong. See
//! design doc §0.1.
//!
//! ## Mechanism pins — deterministic, and deliberately NOT `#[ignore]`d
//!
//! The loop arms measure whether the window is *reachable*. They cannot say what
//! SQLite returns when it IS reached, because `transition` maps every rusqlite
//! error to the unit variant `EngineError::Storage` with `.map_err(|_| ...)` and —
//! unlike `write_inner`, which at least calls `emit_sqlite_internal_error`
//! (`lib.rs:5097`) — emits NO lifecycle event at all. The numeric code is not
//! merely opaque on this path, it is never produced.
//!
//! So the mechanism is pinned deterministically instead, by holding the write lock
//! from a second connection rather than racing for it:
//!
//! * [`tc90_mechanism_transition_sql_shape_on_real_schema_is_busy_5`] replays
//!   `transition`'s two statements VERBATIM against a real engine-created
//!   `canonical_nodes`, with a counting busy handler installed.
//! * [`tc90_mechanism_engine_transition_under_held_write_lock_survives`] drives
//!   the current [`Engine::transition`] under a synchronized, bounded held lock.
//! * [`tc90_mechanism_control_engine_write_under_held_write_lock_survives`] drives
//!   the already-`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` [`Engine::write`] under the SAME held lock. It
//!   is the direct evidence for whether TC-57's R1 remedy transfers here.
//!
//! ## Test profile — which targets run in the DEFAULT `cargo test` gate
//!
//! Decided deliberately per target, not by reflex (codex §9 round 4 finding 3).
//! The gating question is TC-72: roughly 1 workspace run in 3 already fails on
//! plain `main`, so anything timing-sensitive added to the default profile makes
//! that worse and must earn its place.
//!
//! **`#[ignore]`d — all four LOOP arms.** They race a live projection worker
//! against live writer threads; their results are RATES, i.e. measurements, and
//! `cargo test --workspace` is not a stable signal for them. The pair is enabled
//! and disabled as one unit — a comparison with one arm running is worse than no
//! comparison. Run with `--ignored`.
//!
//! **LIVE in the default profile — all three `tc90_mechanism_*` pins**, on the
//! same basis TC-57's own `tc57_mechanism_*` pins run that way. None races for
//! lock ownership: the contending lock is synchronized before the measured call.
//! Pin 1 preserves SQLite's historical deferred-promotion behavior; pins 2 and 3
//! prove current immediate transactions wait and survive. Their wall-clock
//! assertions are one-sided bounds with large margins, not equalities:
//!
//! | pin | shape | timing assertion | measured | margin |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | 1 (`..._sql_shape_...`) | two connections, ONE thread, no sleeps | `< 500 ms` | 0 ms | fails instantly by construction — the busy handler is skipped |
//! | 2 (`..._engine_transition_...`) | blocker thread handshakes `ready` → `ack`, then holds 250 ms | `>= 125 ms`, succeeds | bounded wait | current transition takes `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; its 5 000 ms busy timeout leaves ample slack |
//! | 3 (`..._control_engine_write_...`) | blocker thread handshakes `ready` → `ack`, then holds 900 ms | `>= 450 ms` | 930–937 ms (N = 20, quiet); 934–940 ms (N = 10) under a 24-way CPU load | the holder takes the lock BEFORE the timer starts and does not begin its 900 ms hold until AFTER the timer starts, so release cannot precede `started + 900 ms`; the writer's 5 000 ms busy timeout leaves ~4.1 s of slack |
//!
//! Pins 2 and 3 use blocker threads. Pin 2 is the Slice 30 regression contract;
//! pin 3 remains the load-bearing control that established TC-57's R1 remedy
//! transfers (design doc §3.3).
//!
//! Each blocker thread is synchronised by a **two-phase handshake**. For pin 3,
//! getting there
//! took two corrections. codex §9 round 5 (finding 4) removed a fixed 100 ms
//! sleep that only *assumed* the blocker had won the scheduler. codex §9 round 6
//! (finding 1) then found that its replacement — a single readiness signal —
//! started the 900 ms hold when the blocker *signalled*, leaving the gap between
//! `recv_timeout` returning and `Instant::now()` unguarded: a long enough
//! deschedule of the main thread in that gap released the lock before the
//! measured call began and failed the bound on a correct engine. The shape is
//! now `ready` → `ack` → hold, so `started <= ack <= hold begins` and the bound
//! follows from the ordering.
//!
//! That is a soundness property of the ordering, **not** a claim that the pin is
//! timing-free: it still asserts a wall-clock lower bound, and TC-72 says such
//! targets must earn their place in the merge gate. **If it ever does flake,
//! gate it — do not widen the bound**, which is the assertion that makes it mean
//! anything.

// Arms 3 and 4 — the STRESS pairing
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The paced pair above mirrors TC-57's shape. It is not, on its own, enough to
// support a NEGATIVE: "0/10 at this load" says nothing about a wider window. The
// stress pair widens every knob that could plausibly open one:
//
//   * `burst: 24` > `PROJECTION_COMMIT_BATCH` (16), so the worker commits FULL
//     16-job transactions — the longest write-lock hold it ever takes, i.e. the
//     widest target the promotion can be offered.
//   * `writer_threads: 2` == `PROJECTION_WORKERS`, so both workers can be
//     committing while the transition loop runs.
//   * `writer_pace_ms: 1`, near-saturating: the competing threads contend for the
//     connection mutex almost continuously, which maximises the chance one of them
//     wins the mutex in the gap between `transition`'s `drain` returning and its
//     own acquisition. MEASURED: at `writer_pace_ms: 0` the load is so heavy that
//     `transition`'s own `drain` NEVER reaches idle and every call burns the full
//     30 s timeout into `EngineError::Scheduler` (5 attempts in 180 s, 4 of them
//     `Scheduler`) — an arm that cannot measure the promote race at all.
//   * `embed_delay_ms: 0`: the worker commits microseconds after the competing
//     write releases the connection mutex, rather than 1-2 ms after. This is the
//     knob that MATTERS — see [`ArmConfig::embed_delay_ms`].
//
// A `Scheduler` error here is NOT the defect under test — it is `transition`'s
// own `drain` burning its 30 s timeout under saturating load. It is counted and
// reported SEPARATELY for exactly that reason, and it is a finding in its own
// right (see the design doc).

/// **The protocol, asserted rather than described.** ALL FOUR arms call this
/// BEFORE their `storage_errors` oracle.
///
/// codex §9 round 4 finding 1. The first draft of the stress arms asserted only
/// `attempted > 0`, which is far too weak for what the design doc claims they
/// measure, and no arm asserted its `Scheduler` / other-variant counts at all.
/// Under that bar a run that issued **one** transition, or truncated at its
/// wall-clock budget, or was dominated by `Scheduler` drain timeouts, would still
/// satisfy the historical green bar in design doc §4 — without ever having
/// measured the promotion race the doc documents. **An acceptance bar is only as good as
/// what it refuses to accept**, so every parameter of the protocol is pinned
/// here.
///
/// These are not aspirational numbers. All four conditions are what the baseline
/// measurement at `94f09d7d` actually produced, in **every** one of the 10 runs
/// of each of the four arms: the full transition count attempted, never
/// truncated, `scheduler_errors == 0`, `other_errors == 0`. Re-measured after
/// this tightening — see design doc §2.2.
///
/// Note the deliberate consequence for [`ArmConfig::budget`]: truncation is now a
/// hard FAILURE rather than a silently shorter measurement. The budget remains a
/// safety valve against an unbounded arm — the `writer_pace_ms: 0` shape burns a
/// 30 s drain timeout per call (design doc §2.5) — but an arm that hits it has

/// 21a-2 fix). Under the identical held-write-lock contention that pin 2 shows
/// killing `transition`, an `IMMEDIATE` transaction goes through the busy handler
/// instead of being refused: it WAITS for the lock and then succeeds.
///
/// The blocker releases after [`HOLD`], well inside rusqlite's default 5 000 ms
/// busy timeout, so the wait is bounded and the test cannot hang.
///
/// **The two threads HANDSHAKE; nothing here is slept for or assumed** — and
/// this took two corrections to get right, both of which are worth keeping
/// visible.
///
/// 1. codex §9 round 5 finding 4 killed a fixed 100 ms sleep that merely
///    *assumed* the blocker had won the scheduler.
/// 2. codex §9 round 6 finding 1 killed its replacement, a single readiness
///    signal, because the hold began when the blocker **signalled** — leaving
///    the gap between `recv_timeout` returning and `Instant::now()` unguarded.
///    A long enough deschedule of the main thread in that gap released the lock
///    before the measured call began, failing `elapsed >= HOLD / 2` on a
///    perfectly correct engine.
///
/// The shape now is `ready` → `ack` → hold: the blocker announces the lock, the
/// main thread starts its timer and *then* acknowledges, and only on that
/// acknowledgement does the blocker begin its [`HOLD`]. Because
/// `started <= ack sent <= ack received = hold begins`, the lock is released no
/// earlier than `started + HOLD`, and the measured call cannot return before the
/// release because it needs that same lock. The bound follows from the ordering
/// rather than from the scheduler being kind. Both waits carry [`READY_TIMEOUT`]
/// as a hang-guard so a thread that never arrives fails loudly.
///
/// What this does NOT claim is that the pin is timing-free: it still asserts a
/// wall-clock lower bound, and a pathological stall of several seconds between
/// `started` and the writer reaching `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` would eat into the
/// 5 000 ms busy timeout. **If it ever does flake, gate it — do not widen the
/// bound**, which is the assertion that makes it mean anything.
