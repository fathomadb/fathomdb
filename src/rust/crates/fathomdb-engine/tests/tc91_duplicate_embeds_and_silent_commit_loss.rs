//! 0.8.20 Slice 23 characterization and Slice 40 regression coverage for
//! **TC-91**.
//!
//! ## Current status
//!
//! The long baseline narrative below is retained as historical evidence for the
//! defect. TC-91 now acquires worker writer intent before its reads and reports
//! exceptional commit failures. The explicit concurrency arms are therefore
//! acceptance evidence: every arm requires zero duplicate ingest embeds.
//!
//! TC-91 (ledger `seq-129`, p2) is two defects on the same code path, which this
//! file HYPOTHESISES — but does **not** establish — share one mechanism (see
//! "What those numbers DO and DO NOT prove" below, and design doc §5.5.2):
//!
//! * **(a)** roughly half of all embeds at baseline are DUPLICATES. It reproduces
//!   on the ANONYMOUS arm too, so it is not the governed-write race TC-57 fixed,
//!   and it did not go away with that fix. Harm class: wasted embed work.
//!   Invisible to correctness tests, because a duplicate embed produces the right
//!   answer — twice.
//! * **(b)** at the Slice 23 baseline, the projection worker discarded its
//!   commit result. Slice 40 propagates the result to the worker loop and starts
//!   the commit transaction with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.
//!
//! Slice 23 established the characterization at baseline `94f09d7d`. Slice 40
//! turns the bounded governed-rate and forced-contention arms into regressions;
//! the remaining timing-sensitive characterization arms stay opt-in. Written
//! characterization: `dev/design/0.8.20-tc90-tc91-characterization.md`.
//!
//! ## The durable point of (b), and why it is the most valuable thing here
//!
//! At baseline the two worker paths silently discarded
//! `commit_projection_outcomes` errors.
//!
//! A `'failed'` terminal and a `projection_failures` audit row are written by the
//! `ProjectionOutcome::Failure` arm (`lib.rs:13962-13984`), which represents an
//! **embed** failure. A **commit** failure never reaches that arm at all: the
//! whole transaction rolls back, the row keeps `terminal IS NULL`, the worker loop
//! sets `pending_scan = true` (`lib.rs:12663`), the dispatcher re-fetches the row
//! and it is embedded AGAIN.
//!
//! Therefore **counting `'failed'` terminal states was structurally incapable of
//! seeing this class of failure at baseline.**
//! [`tc91_forced_commit_contention_preserves_single_embed`] exercises the same
//! lock shape and requires the remedy to preserve every computed outcome.
//!
//! ## The measurement trap that had to be disarmed FIRST
//!
//! `run_vector_equivalence_probe` (`lib.rs:15309`) embeds the 45-probe fixture at
//! OPEN. Two different figures are on the record and BOTH are true, of different
//! opens: **90** embeds on the population open (populate 45 + check 45), **45** on
//! every open thereafter. Ledger `seq-125` (the TC-71 close) states the
//! consequence: *absolute embed counts are unusable as an oracle across a reopen*
//! — every embed assertion must be a DELTA from a post-open snapshot.
//!
//! **And TC-68 LANDED in Slice 22 (`572475f2`)**, adding the fingerprint verdict
//! cache (`probe_verification_is_cached`, `lib.rs:15566`). The ledger note calling
//! the 45 re-embeds something TC-68 "is scheduled to cache away" PREDATES that
//! landing, so the 45 must not be inherited as a constant.
//! [`tc91_probe_embed_cost_per_open_at_head`] MEASURES it at HEAD instead.
//!
//! Every duplicate figure below is therefore taken from a SINGLE open whose
//! embed log starts empty, and ingest embeds are separated from probe embeds by
//! text: this fixture's bodies all carry [`INGEST_MARKER`], which no probe text
//! contains. The two counts are reported separately, never summed.
//!
//! **MEASURED at HEAD (`94f09d7d`)** by [`tc91_probe_embed_cost_per_open_at_head`]:
//! open 1 (no vector kind) **0**; open 2 (populate + check) **90**; open 3, after
//! TC-68's verdict cache, **0**. The "45 on every open thereafter" figure is
//! therefore NO LONGER TRUE at HEAD — TC-68 took the steady-state reopen probe
//! cost to zero, not merely reduced it. `probe_calls == 0` is asserted in every
//! duplicate arm, so the separation is verified rather than assumed.
//!
//! ## MEASURED at `94f09d7d`
//!
//! These are the counts. What they do and do not license is the section that
//! follows the table — in particular they do **not** establish that (a) is (b).
//!
//! | arm | shape | runs | ingest duplicates / rows |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`tc91_duplicate_embed_rate_governed`] | 200 x 1-row writes, 1 ms apart | 10 | 102-106 / 200 (**52.1 %**) |
//! | [`tc91_duplicate_embed_rate_anonymous`] | same, `logical_id: None` | 10 | 103-110 / 200 (**52.8 %**) |
//! | [`tc91_control_unblocked_worker_commits`] | ONE 96-row batch, no concurrent writer | 10 | **0 / 96** |
//! | forced-contention baseline | same batch + held write lock | 10 | 80-96 / 96 |
//! | [`tc91_mechanism_duplicate_rate_versus_write_cadence`] | 60 rows, 1 ms vs 25 ms apart | 10 | 31-33 vs **0** |
//!
//! Governed and anonymous are indistinguishable, confirming the ledger claim that
//! this is not the TC-57 race.
//!
//! ## What those numbers DO and DO NOT prove — read this before quoting them
//!
//! Two claims are **measured**, and they are the deliverable:
//!
//! 1. The duplicate rate is **CADENCE-SENSITIVE** under this 1 ms embed / 1 ms
//!    write shape: 32.5/60 at 1 ms spacing, **0/60 at 25 ms**, 10/10, and 0/96 for
//!    a single batch with no concurrent writer. So the ~50 % is a property of the
//!    write **cadence**, not a constant of the scheduler, and quoting it without
//!    the cadence it was measured at is meaningless.
//! 2. An **externally held WAL write lock makes discarded worker commits
//!    invisible**: 86.4/96 duplicates while `'failed'` terminals and
//!    `projection_failures` rows are both ZERO, 10/10.
//!
//! The tempting third claim — *"(a) IS (b)"*, i.e. that a duplicate REQUIRES a
//! second writer holding the WAL write lock across the worker's commit — is a
//! **HYPOTHESIS strongly implicated by (1) + (2), not a measured identity**
//! (codex §9 round 4 finding 4). The gap is specific and worth naming, because it
//! is not an oversight:
//!
//! > **There is no direct instrumentation of worker commit failures in the
//! > baseline duplicate arms — because the Slice 23 defect under study discarded
//! > those failures.** TC-91 **(b) is the reason
//! > TC-91 (a) cannot be closed by measurement.** The forced-lock experiment
//! > reproduces the mechanism, but it supplies the lock holder externally; it
//! > cannot show that every baseline duplicate came from the engine's own writer.
//!
//! The supporting code reading is historical: at the Slice 23 baseline,
//! `commit_batch` held `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` while `commit_projection_outcomes` used
//! a deferred read-then-upgrade transaction. Slice 40 now starts both governed
//! writes with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and propagates a commit error to the worker loop.
//! The characterization is still evidence about the baseline mechanism, not an
//! identity proof for every baseline duplicate.
//!
//! In EVERY one of the 50 runs above, `failed_terminals == 0` and
//! `failure_audit_rows == 0`.
//!
//! ## Test profile — which targets run in the DEFAULT `cargo test` gate
//!
//! Decided deliberately per target, not by reflex (codex §9 round 4 finding 3).
//! The gating question is TC-72: roughly 1 workspace run in 3 already fails on
//! plain `main`, so anything timing-sensitive added to the default profile makes
//! that worse and must earn its place.
//!
//! **`#[ignore]`d — timing-characterization arms:**
//! [`tc91_duplicate_embed_rate_anonymous`],
//! [`tc91_mechanism_duplicate_rate_versus_write_cadence`], and
//! [`tc91_control_unblocked_worker_commits`]. They remain measurements, not
//! merge-gate invariants. Run them with `--ignored`.
//!
//! **LIVE in the default profile:**
//! [`tc91_duplicate_embed_rate_governed`] is a bounded 48-row tight-cadence
//! regression and [`tc91_forced_commit_contention_preserves_single_embed`] holds
//! a real external WAL write lock. Each asserts exactly zero duplicate embeds.
//! [`tc91_probe_embed_cost_per_open_at_head`] is a measurement too, but it is
//! **sequential and deterministic**: three opens of one workspace, one write, every
//! `drain` awaited to idle, no second thread and no wall-clock assertion anywhere.
//! Its value comes from a checked-in fixture (`vector_equivalence_probes.txt`) and
//! a code path, so it has no run-to-run variance to flake on — and since it now
//! pins `0 / 90 / 0` exactly, leaving it live is what actually defends the
//! correction the design doc publishes. Gating it would put the corrected figure
//! behind a flag nobody runs.
