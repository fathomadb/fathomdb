//! 0.8.20 Slice 15c (TC-33) fix-4 — the step-23 `canonical_edges` recreate must
//! not STRAND the shared projection cursor on a dropped pending-projection edge.
//!
//! **The finding (codex §9 P1).** `write_cursor` is a SINGLE global sequence
//! shared across nodes AND edges. `advance_projection_cursor` walks the
//! readiness watermark forward ONE value at a time, and only while a
//! `_fathomdb_projection_terminal` row exists for the next cursor. Step 23 drops
//! every `canonical_edges` row (NO DATA MIGRATION, HITL 2026-07-21). If an
//! upgraded v22 DB had a body-bearing edge whose vector projection had NOT
//! completed — so it has NO terminal row — step 23 removes that row but leaves
//! its cursor value with no terminal and no owning row. The projection cursor
//! then stalls PERMANENTLY at that gap, and because the sequence is shared this
//! freezes advancement past SURVIVING node projections too (every upgraded DB's
//! `wait_for_idle` / search-freshness wedges).
//!
//! This is projection-cursor STATE bookkeeping, not data preservation: the fix
//! records a terminal for every dropped edge cursor BEFORE the DROP, so the
//! cursor can walk past it. The edge data still does not survive.
//!
//! **Why the terminal state is `'up_to_date'`, NOT `'superseded'`.** The
//! `_fathomdb_projection_terminal` table (step 7) carries a structural
//! `CHECK(state IN ('failed', 'up_to_date'))`, and every writer uses
//! `INSERT OR IGNORE`. Under SQLite, `OR IGNORE` SKIPS a row that violates a
//! CHECK and returns NO error — so a backfill written as `'superseded'` would be
//! SILENTLY DROPPED and the cursor would still stall (a vacuous green). The only
//! CHECK-valid, non-alarming terminal is `'up_to_date'`: it means "nothing left
//! to project here", which is exactly true of a row the recreate deleted, and it
//! keeps `projection_status` out of the `'failed'` arm. `fix4_superseded_token_
//! is_rejected_by_check` pins that OR-IGNORE-swallows-CHECK behaviour so a future
//! reader cannot "simplify" the token back to `'superseded'`.
