//! 0.8.20 Slice 15c (TC-33) fix-6 — the step-23 `canonical_edges` recreate must
//! not ORPHAN the dropped edges' VECTOR projection.
//!
//! **The finding (codex §9 P1).** Step 23 drops every `canonical_edges` row (NO
//! DATA MIGRATION, HITL 2026-07-21). Before fix-6 it cleared the edge FTS
//! projection (`search_index_edges`) and recorded projection terminals (fix-4),
//! but it never removed the dropped edges' rows from the VECTOR projection. That
//! projection has two row-owned halves (engine `ROW_OWNED_PROJECTIONS`, class
//! `Vector`): the `_fathomdb_vector_rows` sidecar/registry table, and the vec0
//! `vector_default` virtual table that actually feeds KNN candidate selection. An
//! orphaned edge vector row (whose `canonical_edges` row is gone) still occupies a
//! top-K candidate slot and is discarded at hydration, so an upgraded DB returns
//! too few / no vector results even though valid node vectors sit just below the
//! cutoff.
//!
//! **This file covers the MIGRATION half** — the `_fathomdb_vector_rows` sidecar
//! delete, which step 23 owns (that table is created by migration step 6 and
//! always exists during migration). The vec0 `vector_default` half cannot be
//! referenced in the migration SQL (it is engine-created and dim-parameterized,
//! and does not exist in the schema crate's migration context), so it is pruned by
//! the ENGINE right after `ensure_vector_partition` and is covered by the
//! `tc33_fix6_edge_vector_prune` engine test.
//!
//! Assertions are on RAW table contents (the property is at-rest): the dropped
//! edge's sidecar row is gone AND the node's sidecar row is untouched (proving the
//! delete is scoped to edge cursors, not an over-broad truncate — nodes and edges
//! share the single `_fathomdb_vector_rows` table).
