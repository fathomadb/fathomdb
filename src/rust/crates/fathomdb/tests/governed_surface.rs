//! AC-074 (Rust-facade measurement, Q5 = BIND-RUST) — the Rust-facade
//! governed-surface positive-allowlist / parity pin.
//!
//! Binds **AC-074** (`dev/acceptance.md`, REQ-053), NOT a new AC id. Under the
//! signed `ADR-0.8.0-supersede-five-verb-surface-cap` (Q5 = BIND-RUST) AC-074
//! *also* binds the Rust facade; Slice 25 landed the Python + TypeScript half
//! and this reserved-gap Slice 27 lands the Rust half. See
//! `dev/design/slice-27-rust-allowlist-design.md` and
//! `dev/interfaces/rust.md` § Governed-surface contract (the owner of the set).
//!
//! The Rust facade is a **different consumer contract** than the Py/TS 5-verb +
//! `read.*` SDK: its application verbs are methods on `Engine`, and its public
//! surface is a set of re-exported *types*, not free verbs. Rust also has no
//! runtime symbol-table introspection (no `dir(module)`; `compile_fail`
//! doctests only run for `src/` items, not `tests/`). So — exactly like
//! `reexports.rs` / `no_recovery_surface.rs` — this pin is a **compile-time
//! resolves-check** (`type_name::<…>()` over the allowlisted types) plus a
//! source-inspection-documented contract.
//!
//! Three load-bearing properties (mirroring the Py+TS governed surface, adapted
//! to Rust):
//!
//! - **P1 positive allowlist** — every member of `GOVERNED_SURFACE_ALLOWLIST`
//!   (the curated governed application surface `dev/interfaces/rust.md` owns)
//!   resolves through the `fathomdb` facade.
//! - **P2 parity-in-intent** — posture-consistent with the Py/TS governed
//!   surface (governed allowlist, recovery-denylist-absent, typed/no-raw-SQL),
//!   but NOT membership-identical (a type set, not a verb set). The one shared
//!   element is the recovery denylist, declared once in
//!   `src/conformance/governed-surface-allowlist.json` (`recovery_denylist`);
//!   `RECOVERY_DENYLIST` below pins the same five names.
//! - **P3 denylist-absence** — no governed-surface symbol *is* a recovery verb
//!   in `{recover, restore, repair, fix, rebuild}` (exact, case-insensitive —
//!   NOT substring: the denylist targets recovery *verbs*, while `RecoveryHint`
//!   is a typed open-error hint). The CANONICAL denylist enforcement remains the
//!   byte-frozen `no_recovery_surface.rs`; this file adds the *positive*
//!   allowlist half + an allowlist-scope denylist check.
//!
//! **Slice 27 fix-1 (method level).** The codex [P1] found the type-only audit
//! missed the inherent **methods** on the re-exported `fathomdb::Engine`
//! (`rebuild_projections`/`rebuild_vec0` carried a recovery-denylist name;
//! `execute_for_test` was raw SQL). Per HITL Option B the operator/recovery seam
//! is now feature-gated (`operator`), so the **default** facade `Engine` exposes
//! no recovery-name method and no raw-SQL method. Method **absence** is pinned by
//! the `compile_fail` doctests in `fathomdb/src/lib.rs`
//! (`governed_surface_method_absence_proof` / `release_surface_raw_sql_absence_proof`)
//! — the only mechanism that can assert a method does *not* resolve. This file's
//! `t_074_operator_seam_resolves_with_feature` is the positive counterpart:
//! the seam DOES resolve with `--features operator` (the CLI substrate).
