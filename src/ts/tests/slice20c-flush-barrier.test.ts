// X1 SDK parity — 0.8.20 Slice 20c (R-20-DR remainder): `drain` is the
// flush-to-readiness barrier (`api-surface.md` **C4**).
//
// Drives the barrier through the napi-rs binding by EXECUTION, not symbol
// presence. Mirrors
// `src/rust/crates/fathomdb-engine/tests/slice20c_flush_barrier.rs` and the
// Python suite `src/python/tests/test_slice20c_flush_barrier.py`
// (Py ≡ TS, R-X-1).
//
// The pinned invariant:
//
//     `await engine.drain(timeoutMs)` resolving ⟹ `vectorDenseReadiness ===
//     "ready"` AND every vector-eligible row has its vector row AT REST.
//
// Why the raw-table assertion is load-bearing: a harness that only reads
// readiness back PASSES against the defect. Before this slice
// `configureProjections` never enrolled the kind, so `drain` resolved
// immediately and readiness read `"ready"` with ZERO vectors and nothing that
// would ever create them.
//
// `node:sqlite` is used only as a READ oracle on a CLOSED database.
//
// These tests need a LIVE embedder (`useDefaultEmbedder: true`) because the
// dense arm is what is being flushed; they honour the standing
// `FATHOMDB_SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS` guard, exactly as `embedder-event-narrowing`
// does. The "declaration without a live embedder" test needs no embedder and
// therefore always runs.
//
// ZERO net-new governed commands: this rides the already-governed
// `configureProjections` / `read.projections` verbs plus the shipped
// `engine.drain` INSTRUMENTATION method (TC-55, steward seq-110).
